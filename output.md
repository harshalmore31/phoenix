Foreword	to	the	Revised	Edition

In	 April	 2011,	 in	 a	 cramped	 and	 horribly	 overpriced	 hotel	 room	 in	 London,	 I
began	the	outline	for	a	dating	advice	book.

For	anyone	who	has	tried	to	write	a	book,	they	know	that	starting	it	is	the	most
daunting	part.	There	were	so	many	considerations,	so	many	ideas,	so	many	goals
and	ambitions.	And	for	a	few	days,	I	was	paralyzed	with	all	of	the	potential.

But	 I	 soon	 decided	 to	 limit	 myself	 to	 one	 specific	 aim.	 I	 asked	 myself,	 “What
book	do	I	wish	I	would	have	read	when	I	was	single	and	struggling	in	my	dating
life?	If	I	had	only	read	one	book,	what	do	I	wish	it	had	told	me?”

As	the	weeks	went	by,	it	turned	out	that	I	wished	it	had	told	me	a	lot.	The	book
spilled	out	of	me	in	a	somewhat	involuntary	manner,	a	kind	of	intellectual	vomit.
I	 was	 touring	 Europe,	 giving	 talks	 and	 coaching	 live	 at	 the	 time,	 and	 I	 would
often	finish	up	a	session	with	a	client	or	do	a	Q&A	with	a	small	audience	and
immediately	run	to	my	hotel	room	to	jot	some	of	the	ideas	that	had	spewed	out
of	my	mouth	into	the	now	ballooning	book.

I	 also	 decided	 early	 on	 that	 I	 wanted	 to	 make	 the	 book	 different	 stylistically.	 I
had	read	pretty	much	every	other	dating	advice	book	on	the	market	and	thought
most	 of	 them	 were	 garbage.	 I	 already	 knew	 the	 core	 ideas	 of	 this	 book	 were
going	to	be	different	–	deeper,	more	personal,	more	emotional.	But	I	also	wanted
the	 style	 of	 the	 book	 to	 be	 different.	 Perhaps	 I	 was	 up	 my	 own	 ass	 with	 self-
importance,	 but	 I	 wanted	 to	 give	 it	 a	 bit	 more	 of	 a	 literary	 flair.	 I	 wanted	 the
beauty	 and	 joy	 of	 the	 dating	 experience	 to	 come	 across	 in	 the	 writing	 itself.	 I
didn’t	just	want	to	lay	out	step-by-step	plans	and	information	to	be	memorized,	I
wanted	 to	 move	 the	 reader,	 since	 after	 all,	 the	 whole	 point	 of	 the	 book	 is	 that
dating	 and	 romance	 is	 about	 just	 that:	 allowing	 yourself	 to	 be	 moved,	 both
emotionally	and	physically.

I	wrote	the	book	in	less	than	three	months.	Most	of	it	was	written	in	hotel	rooms
and	 small	 apartments	 across	 Europe:	 first	 London,	 then	 Bristol,	 then	 Prague,
then	St.	Petersburg,	and	it	was	finally	finished	in	Budapest.

The	first	version	of	the	book	was	long	and	sloppy:	366	pages,	with	at	least	that

many	typos,	grammatical	errors,	and	dumb	tangents.	At	the	time,	my	aspirations
were	fairly	pedestrian.	I	wanted	to	be	able	to	make	some	money	online	without
having	to	physically	be	in	one	spot,	as	almost	four	years	of	constant	travel	to	do
the	coaching	thing	was	wearing	on	me.

But	I	also	wanted	to	get	my	ideas	out	into	the	world	and	hopefully	make	a	dent
in	the	dating	advice	industry	since,	at	the	time,	I	felt	that	what	I	had	to	say	was
quite	different	from	the	vast	majority	of	toxic	“Pick	Up”	advice	that	was	being
taught	to	men.

The	book	came	out	on	July	5th,	2011.	It	was	self-published	through	Amazon	and
my	 own	 website.	 That	 first	 month	 it	 only	 sold	 a	 few	 hundred	 copies	 –	 mostly
blog	readers	and	former	clients	of	mine.	Many	of	them	reported	to	me	many	of
the	mistakes	and	helped	me	edit	 it	over	 the	proceeding	 weeks	and	a	few	 small
updates	were	released	soon	after.	By	the	fall	of	that	year,	I	felt	good	that	it	was
out	there	and	people	liked	it	and	soon	moved	on	to	other	projects.

But	as	the	months	rolled	on,	the	book	began	to	take	on	a	life	of	its	own.	With	no
marketing,	 no	 publicity,	 no	 promotion,	 and	 a	 shitty	 cover	 I	 made	 myself	 in
Photoshop,	the	book’s	sales	grew	exponentially	each	month.	Like	a	mind	virus,
infecting	 people’s	 brains	 so	 that	 they	 could	 move	 on	 and	 infect	 others,	 men
began	recommending	it	to	their	friends,	and	then	their	friends	recommended	it	to
their	friends,	and	soon	their	friends’	friends	were	buying	it	for	their	brothers	and
cousins	 and	 even	 newly	 divorced	 fathers	 and	 uncles.	 It	 was	 soon	 being
recommended	on	websites	and	forums	so	much	that	I	began	to	get	emails	asking
me	to	stop	spamming.	But	I	wasn’t	spamming.	I	wasn’t	doing	anything.	It	was
simply	the	readers.

By	early	2012,	to	my	pleasant	surprise,	I	was	earning	enough	to	make	a	living	as
an	 author.	 So	 I	 quit	 coaching	 and	 focused	 solely	 on	 my	 writing.	 That	 same
summer	I	also	gave	the	book	its	first	real	revision.	I	hired	a	designer	to	create	a
real	 cover.	 I	 chopped	 about	 50	 of	 the	 more	 pedantic	 and	 excessive	 pages.	 I
simplified	some	of	the	terms	and	theories	and	tried	to	make	them	more	reader-
friendly.	What	I	consider	the	first	‘professional’	version	of	Models	was	released
in	August	of	2012.

From	there	the	book	went	on	to	become	the	highest	selling	men’s	dating	advice
book	for	years	at	a	time,	outselling	mainstays	such	as	Neil	Strauss’s	The	 Game
and	 Erik	 Von	 Markovik’s	 The	 Mystery	 Method,	 often	 even	 outselling	 most

women’s	dating	advice	books,	which	is	kind	of	unheard	of	in	the	industry.	It	was
a	 perennial	 bestseller	 in	 the	 category	 on	 Amazon	 and	 has	 actually	 reached	 a
point	 where	 many	 popular	 men’s	 dating	 advice	 forums	 and	 sites	 list	 it	 with	 a
“read	this	before	asking	any	questions”	note	in	their	FAQs	or	sidebars.

By	2013,	I	felt	as	though	I	was	finished	with	the	book.	I	was	ready	to	move	on.	I
was	preparing	to	relaunch	my	site	and	start	writing	articles	for	both	genders	with
topics	ranging	from	personal	psychology	to	the	cultural	 effects	of	smartphones
and	newsfeeds.	I	was	leaving	dating	advice	behind	for	good.

Over	the	next	two	years,	my	site’s	popularity	exploded.	Over	20	million	people
read	 it	 in	 2015	 alone.	 Yet	 Models	 has	 always	 persisted,	 always	 there	 in	 the
background.	Always	a	throbbing	reminder	of	where	I	came	from,	as	well	as	the
virtue	of	taking	a	calculated	risk	and	seeing	where	it	led	me.

Because,	most	people	don’t	realize	this	now,	but	Models	was	a	huge	risk	when	it
came	out.

See,	back	in	2011,	few	pieces	of	dating	or	relationship	advice	talked	about	blunt
honesty,	 about	 accepting	 rejection	 or	 even	 polarizing	 people	 for	 negative
responses.	 Vulnerability	 was	 considered	 a	 vulgar	 word	 among	 most	 men	 and
anything	that	didn’t	get	you	laid	as	soon	as	possible	was	often	deemed	pointless,
or	even	worse,	being	“beta.”

And,	 god	forbid,	 you	 talk	 about	 emotions	 or	 trauma	 or	 feelings	 of	 inadequacy.
Like	 really,	 who	 the	 fuck	 wants	 to	 hear	 about	 that,	 you	 pussy?	 Go	 approach
more!

But	I	had	known	from	working	with	hundreds	of	men	around	the	world	that	most
of	their	dating	problems	had	little	to	do	with	“knowing	what	to	say”	or	tactics	to
get	women	to	sleep	with	them	sooner.	The	vast	majority	of	these	men’s	problems
were	 emotional.	 They	 were	 rooted	 in	 deep	 inabilities	 to	 experience	 intimacy.
They	were	born	out	of	an	irrationally	negative	self-perception	that	came	from	a
lifetime	of	feeling	inferior	and	inadequate	around	women.	They	came	from	men
who	were	scared	to	look	reality	in	the	eye	and	still	smile.

I	 knew	 when	 I	 put	 these	 pages	 together	 that	 they	 were	 either	 going	 to	 revamp
much	 of	 the	 industry	 or	 they	 were	 going	 to	 be	 laughed	 off	 the	 Amazon	 sales
page	and	I’d	soon	go	get	a	day	job.

But	today,	I’m	happy	to	say	that	much	of	the	men’s	dating	advice	industry	has
followed	 suit	 and	 is	 now	 extolling	 the	 virtues	 of	 honest	 expression,	 of	 finding
courage	 and	 confidence	 through	 vulnerability,	 and	 investing	 oneself	 into
becoming	 a	 better	 man	 rather	 than	 simply	 appearing	 as	 though	 you’re	 a	 better
man.

Sometimes	I	get	emails	from	readers	who	send	me	videos	or	passages	from	other
dating	 advice	 companies	 or	 coaches,	 who	 five	 years	 ago	 were	 the	 king	 of	 the
douches,	who	used	to	wear	ridiculous	outfits	and	give	“advice”	such	as	whipping
out	your	cock	in	public	and	screaming	nonsense	at	women.	Now,	many	of	these
men	are	preaching	the	virtues	of	living	honestly	and	respecting	women’s	desires
as	well	as	your	own.	Often	the	reader	will	ask	me,	“This	guy	is	ripping	you	off,
does	this	piss	you	off?”	And	actually,	it	doesn’t.	It	makes	me	happy	and	proud.

I	was	born	in	Texas	and	we	have	a	tendency	to	prattle	on	about	ourselves	(if	you
imagine	me	sitting	on	a	porch	sipping	a	can	of	cheap	beer	with	a	shotgun	strewn
across	 my	 lap,	 that’s	 about	 how	 writing	 all	 of	 this	 feels),	 so	 let	 me	 cut	 to	 the
chase	here	and	answer	what	you’re	probably	wondering,	“What	the	hell	is	with
the	latest	revision	and	why	did	you	do	it?”

This	latest	revision	comes	on	the	tail	end	of	finishing	a	new	book	to	be	published
in	 2016.	 Upon	 completing	 that	 book,	 I	 looked	 back	 through	 Models	 and	 once
again	felt	that	it	was	in	need	of	an	update,	particularly	in	the	writing	department.
I	still	feel	good	about	the	core	ideas	and	advice	of	the	book.	But	in	the	four	years
since	 I	 last	 touched	 it,	 my	 writing	 has	 improved	 by	 leaps	 and	 bounds	 and	 my
explicative	 abilities	 have	 grown.	 So,	 once	 again,	 I	 combed	 through	 the	 text:
concepts	were	clarified,	advice	was	reworded	to	be	more	precise,	and	excessive
nonsense	was	trimmed	or	removed	entirely.	This	version	of	Models	that	you	are
reading	 right	 now	 is	 the	 clearest,	 most	 concise,	 and	 therefore,	 likely	 the	 most
powerful	version	to	date.	I’m	confident	in	that.

For	older	readers,	changes	include:

Removing	 most	 of	 Chapter	 1	 and	 moving	 some	 sections	 to	 other	 parts	 of
the	book.
Changing	 ‘True	 Confidence’	 back	 to	 ‘non-neediness’	 (the	 original	 term
from	the	first	version).	I	put	‘True	Confidence’	in	the	second	version	of	the
book	because	I	thought	that	it	was	more	digestible	to	the	average	reader.	In

hindsight,	I	think	it’s	just	a	vague	and	"feel	good"	term.	I	always	liked	(and
most	readers	still	prefer)	the	original	term	that	I	totally	made	up	out	of	thin
air:	 non-neediness.	 This	 term	 has	 been	 re-instated	 along	 with	 added
explanation	of	where	it	came	from.
Changing	 ‘False	 Confidence’	 to	 narcissism.	 Narcissism	 is	 a	 new	 term
entirely	 for	 the	 book	 and	 one	 that	 I	 think	 is	 more	 precise	 and
comprehensible.	Although	I	do	think	‘False	Confidence’	is	a	pretty	accurate
description	of	narcissism	in	most	cases.
Being	more	explicit	about	the	ideas	of	consent,	recognizing	and	responding
to	how	women	feel,	and	basically	treating	them	like	people	and	not	objects.
This	 was	 always	 implied	 in	 earlier	 versions	 of	 the	 book,	 but	 after	 being
horrified	at	some	of	the	emails	I	get	from	men	and	how	they	interpret	the
book,	 I’ve	 decided	 to	 be	 more	 explicit	 about	 this.	 This	 is	 a	 book	 about
people	speaking	and	relating	to	other	people,	not	obtaining	objects	or	status
symbols.
Cleaned	up	a	lot	of	the	writing.	Made	some	sections	less	dry.	Added	a	bit
more	humor.
Deleted	 about	 30	 pages	 of	 unnecessary	 tangential	 stuff,	 repetitive
explanations,	and	just	long,	rambly	writing	in	places.

If	you’re	new	to	the	book,	don’t	worry	about	the	changes,	just	dive	right	into	it.
If	you’re	an	older	reader,	then	the	first	few	chapters	and	the	last	few	are	the	ones
with	the	most	added/changed,	while	Chapter	8	(formerly	9)	is	the	one	with	the
most	removed.

In	the	end,	although	existing	in	a	genre	that’s	considered	by	most	to	be	a	joke,
I’m	incredibly	proud	of	this	book.	Not	only	did	it	birth	me	a	career	doing	what	I
love,	 but	 I	 feel	 as	 though	 it	 took	 my	 wildest	 aspirations	 when	 I	 wrote	 it	 and
surpassed	them	with	ease.	Most	books	die	off	after	a	couple	years,	but	Models
continues	 to	 chug	 along,	 as	 resilient	 and	 polarizing	 and	 vulnerable	 as	 ever,
changing	the	lives	of	men	in	its	wake.

Or	at	least,	that’s	what	I	like	to	tell	myself.

And	 for	 most	 of	 that	 success,	 I	 have	 nobody	 to	 thank	 but	 you:	 the	 returning
readers,	 the	 people	 who	 read	 the	 book	 and	 shared	 it	 with	 their	 friends	 or
recommended	it	on	websites,	the	people	who	bought	five	copies	and	gave	it	to
their	friends	and	family	members.	Without	your	enthusiasm	and	support	for	the
ideas	here,	especially	early	on,	they	would	likely	have	been	lost	to	the	cesspool

of	failed	self-published	books	on	Amazon.	So	to	you,	thank	you.

A	Quick	Note	to	Female	and	LGBT
Readers

The	popularity	of	Models	has	brought	it	to	the	attention	of	a	number	of	people
that	 the	 book	 was	 not	 originally	 conceptualized	 and	 written	 for.	 A	 number	 of
single	women,	as	well	as	gay,	lesbian,	bi,	and	trans	people	have	emailed	me	over
the	years	asking	if	the	book’s	concepts	apply	to	them.

At	 first,	 this	 surprised	 me.	 And	 then	 what	 surprised	 me	 more	 is	 that	 as	 I	 went
through	 the	 concepts	 in	 the	 book,	 I	 realized	 that	 the	 answer	 was	 a	 resounding
‘yes,’	these	concepts	apply	to	everyone.	Although	there	are	a	few	caveats.

The	 core	 principles	 of	 the	 book	 –	 Non-Neediness	 (Chapter	 1),	 Vulnerability
(Chapters	 2-3),	 Unconditionality	 (Chapter	 3),	 Polarization	 and	 Rejection
(Chapters	 4-6),	 Demographics	 (	 Chapter	 7),	 Overcoming	 Shame	 and	 Anxiety
(Chapters	 9-10),	 and	 Intentions	 (Chapter	 11)	 –	 apply	 to	 all	 human	 beings,
regardless	of	gender,	orientation,	genitalia	or	whatever.

The	 parts	 of	 the	 book	 that	 won’t	 directly	 apply	 are	 a	 number	 of	 the	 specific
examples	 and	 implementations	 of	 these	 core	 principles.	 For	 example,	 in	 most
cultures,	 men	 are	 expected	 to	 initiate	 in	 almost	 every	 phase	 of	 courtship,
therefore,	 the	 anxieties	 they	 face	 (Chapters	 9-10),	 the	 challenges	 with
vulnerability	 they	 will	 confront	 (Chapter	 3)	 and	 so	 on,	 will	 look	 a	 little	 bit
different	than	they	would	for	a	hetero	woman	or	someone	of	another	orientation.

As	long	as	you	keep	this	in	mind	as	you	move	throughout	the	book	and	attempt
to	 apply	 the	 core	 principles	 to	 your	 own	 dating	 situation,	 you	 should	 be	 fine.
Women,	 like	 men,	 must	 polarize.	 Gay	 men	 must	 work	 on	 their	 neediness	 and
vulnerability	as	well.	Lesbians	must	learn	to	look	at	the	intentions	behind	their
communication	 rather	 than	 communication	 itself.	 But	 because	 the	 book	 was
initially	written	for	a	hetero	male	audience,	the	examples	and	specific	pieces	of
advice	given	are	for	their	situations.

A	 number	 of	 female	 readers	 have	 requested	 that	 I	 write	 a	 female	 version	 of
Models	and	that	is	something	I	might	do	one	day.	But	in	the	meantime,	this	is	all
we’ve	got.

As	a	final	note,	the	only	Chapters	that	I	feel	are	primarily	written	for	the	hetero
male	situation	are	Chapters	8	and	14.	Other	readers	will	find	these	chapters	the
least	relevant.	The	Introduction	(which	begins	on	the	next	page)	is	also	largely
oriented	towards	hetero	men	and	discusses	modern-day	masculinity.	So	feel	free
to	skip	it	and	go	straight	to	Chapter	1.

Introduction:	Movement

In	our	post-industrial,	post-feminist	world,	it’s	not	as	clear	as	it	used	to	be	what	a
man	 is	 or	 what	 he	 should	 be.	 Centuries	 ago,	 a	 man’s	 duty	 was	 power	 and
protection.	Decades	ago,	it	was	to	work	and	provide.	But	now?	We’re	not	quite
sure.	We	are	either	the	first	or	second	generation	of	men	to	grow	up	without	a
clear	definition	of	what	our	social	roles	are	supposed	to	be	and	without	a	model
of	what	it	is	to	be	strong	and	attractive	men.

This	book’s	goal	is	to	provide	that	model,	to	provide	a	model	of	what	being	an
attractive	man	of	integrity	and	maturity	looks	like	in	the	21st	century.	That	means
going	past	the	standards	of	protector	and	provider,	of	strength	and	stoicism,	and
improving	 ourselves	 into	 something	 bigger	 and	 better,	 something	 more
admirable	and	desirable.

Ten	years	ago,	when	I	first	began	helping	men	improve	their	relationships	with
women,	I	had	no	idea	the	rabbit	hole	of	information	and	self-improvement	I	was
about	 to	 go	 down,	 both	 for	 myself	 and	 for	 others.	 At	 the	 time,	 the	 primary
concerns	in	my	dating	life	revolved	around	which	drink	specials	were	going	on
that	Thursday	night	and	which	one	of	the	five	Jennas	in	my	phone	was	the	one	I
met	last	weekend.

It	wasn’t	until	I	sat	down	and	tried	to	get	other	men	to	the	point	where	they	had
five	 Jennas	 in	 their	 phone	 that	 I	 had	 a	 glimpse	 of	 the	 profundity	 and
underdevelopment	of	most	men’s	emotional	and	sexual	world	and	how	difficult
it	is	to	inspire	a	genuine	movement	within	them	to	open	up	that	world.

I	 won’t	 lie,	 in	 hindsight,	 getting	 myself	 to	 that	 point	 seems	 easy	 now	 by
comparison.	 Growing	 up,	 I	 had	 always	 been	 somewhat	 of	 an	 average	 guy,
although	I	had	little	luck	with	the	ladies.

Then	in	2005,	after	being	cheated	on	and	left	by	my	first	love,	I	was	emotionally
distraught	 and	 slightly	 traumatized.	 I	 became	 obsessive.	 A	 desperate	 need	 for
validation	and	affection	from	women	arose	within	me	and	I	spent	an	inordinate
amount	of	time	pursuing	that	validation	and	affection,	far	more	than	most	men
ever	do.	I	overcompensated	and	soon	became	driven	to	sleep	with	every	girl	in

the	Boston	area	who	would	let	me	anywhere	near	her.

This	went	on	for	a	little	more	than	three	years.

My	plan	wasn’t	sophisticated.	Really,	I	read	a	couple	books	with	pick	up	lines
and	techniques	and	went	out	to	bars	4-5	nights	a	week	—	approaching,	flirting
and	failing,	pushing	and	pulling,	fucking	and	floundering	for	those	36	glorious
months	of	experimentation.

It	was	self-indulgent.	But	it	was	a	time	of	growth	and	a	time	of	movement.

But	a	couple	of	years	and	a	few	dozen	women	later,	two	things	happened.	First,	I
began	to	realize	that	rampant	drunken	sex	was	fun,	but	not	very	fulfilling.	And	it
wasn’t	exactly	affecting	the	other	areas	of	my	life	in	a	healthy	manner.	I	had	to
back	up	and	evaluate	myself,	to	question	why	I	was	sacrificing	so	much	time	and
effort	for	superficial	pleasures.

The	second	thing	that	happened	was	I	grew	a	reputation	locally	for	my	exploits.
Soon	men	whom	I	had	never	met	were	emailing	me	asking	if	they	could	come
hang	out	with	me,	to	see	how	I	interacted	with	women,	to	watch	me	“in	action.”
It	was	weird	at	first.	But	then	I	decided,	sure,	why	not,	just	buy	my	drinks	or	pay
me	a	bit	on	the	side.

And	strangely,	I	feel	like	that’s	where	the	real	journey	began.	To	try	and	model
the	internal	movement,	the	opening	of	those	emotional	worlds,	that	burgeoning
of	a	new	confidence	that	had	been	occurring	within	myself,	and	then	replicate	it
in	other	men.

They	 say	 if	 you	 want	 to	 master	 something,	 teach	 it.	 And	 this	 second	 journey
actually	ended	up	being	far	more	educational	than	the	first.	When	I	went	out	for
myself,	 it	 was	 easy.	 Half	 the	 time	 I	 was	 going	 out	 to	 lose	 myself,	 to	 bury	 my
emotions	and	hopefully	wake	up	in	the	arms	of	a	stranger.	Sometimes	it	worked.
Sometimes	it	didn’t.	And	that’s	really	all	I	knew.

But	 this	 second	 journey	 had	 a	 purpose,	 had	 a	 meaning,	 and	 I	 found	 myself	 in
need	of	an	intellectual	foundation.	I	couldn’t	just	do	it,	I	had	to	teach	it,	explain
it,	and	impart	it	unto	other	men	and	then	get	them	to	do	it.

This	led	me	in	a	winding,	twisted	path.	It	began	with	entries	into	and	exits	out	of
the	 so-called	 “Pick	 Up	 Artist”	 community.	 I	 researched	 social	 psychology,

theories	 behind	 attraction,	 historiographies	 on	 human	 sexuality,	 went	 on	 strip
club	binges,	read	books	on	NLP	and	cognitive	therapy,	attended	various	self-help
seminars	 and	 taught	 a	 few	 myself,	 shared	 hotel	 rooms	 with	 runway	 models,
experimented	 with	 touch-healing	 and	 had	 a	 few	 alternative	 therapy	 mishaps,
engaged	in	gender	arguments	with	feminists,	and	read	every	crappy	dating	book
on	the	market.

As	 I	 learned	 and	 grew,	 the	 coaching	 grew.	 What	 began	 as	 a	 sideshow	 hobby
turned	 into	 a	 business	 —	 and	 a	 full-time	 business	 at	 that.	 It	 soon	 took	 me	 to
more	 than	 two	 dozen	 cities	 across	 America,	 then	 to	 countries	 in	 Europe,	 to
England	 and	 Australia,	 and	 I	 even	 took	 field	 trips	 as	 far	 as	 Argentina,	 Brazil,
Russia,	 Israel,	 and	 Thailand,	 where	 I	 discovered	 that	 much	 of	 what	 I	 had
previously	 assumed	 about	 men	 and	 women	 was	 merely	 cultural	 and	 not
universal.

It	was	a	period	of	immense	education	and	drive,	where	I	made	a	clear	point	to
not	 let	 my	 thinking	 be	 confined	 by	 any	 previous	 model	 or	 paradigm	 about
masculinity	or	male/female	sexuality.

And	after	all	of	that,	over	ten	enriching	and	challenging	years,	this	is	what	I’ve
come	back	with:

There	are	two	movements	occurring	right	now.

The	 first	 one	 is	 a	 greater	 social	 and	 emotional	 movement	 in	 western	 culture.
There’s	 a	 call	 for	 a	 new	 masculinity	 that’s	 been	 lacking	 for	 generations	 now.
There’s	been	a	void	of	what	men	are,	what	they’re	supposed	to	be,	how	they’re
supposed	to	behave,	and	until	now	no	one	has	moved	to	fill	that	void.

Call	 it	 overly	 ambitious,	 but	 this	 book	 aims	 to	 fill	 that	 void,	 to	 help	 create	 the
future	models	of	masculine	behavior	—	models	to	be	attractive,	powerful	and	in
control	of	your	relationships	with	women	and	with	your	life	in	general.

The	second	movement	is	happening	within	you	personally.	It’s	an	emotional	and
psychological	movement.	You’re	reading	this	because	you	want	to	change.	You
want	to	change	your	interactions	and	relationships	with	the	women	in	your	life.
You	 want	 these	 relationships	 to	 improve.	 You	 want	 these	 relationships	 to	 be
abundant.	You	want	to	feel	confident	and	empowered	around	women,	both	those
you	 know	 and	 those	 you	 don’t	 know	 but	 want	 to	 meet.	 You	 want	 to	 feel	 in
control	 of	 your	 relationships	 with	 them.	 You	 want	 to	 be	 sexual	 with	 women

without	shame	or	hesitation	or	regret	or	pain.

This	second	movement	is	an	internal	movement.	It	took	me	a	long	time	to	come
to	 grips	 with	 that.	 Although	 this	 second	 movement	 often	 begins	 by	 changing
outer	behavior	and	results	in	a	change	of	outer	behavior	—	what	you	say,	what
you	 wear,	 how	 you	 move	 —	 the	 process	 itself	 is	 an	 internal	 one,	 a	 shift	 in
priorities	 and	 self-perception,	 which	 is	 then	 reflected	 in	 one’s	 social	 and
romantic	life.

Because	when	you	change	your	beliefs	and	mindsets,	the	behavior	follows.

This	book	is	designed	to	guide	you	through	that	internal	movement.	The	larger
social	 movement	 is	 merely	 a	 backdrop	 and	 is	 only	 briefly	 explained	 to	 give
context	 to	 your	 current	 situation.	 Your	 failures	 with	 women	 aren’t	 caused
because	 you	 say	 the	 wrong	 thing	 or	 look	 like	 the	 wrong	 guy.	 Words	 and
appearances	are	merely	a	symptom	of	a	greater	internal	problem.

Your	failures	happen	because	you	grew	up	emotionally	ill	equipped	to	deal	with
women,	and	more	specifically,	intimacy.	The	words	you	say	and	looks	you	have
are	merely	a	side	effect	of	that	internal	lack	of	ability.

This	isn’t	just	about	intellectually	understanding	how	to	stand,	how	to	talk,	how
to	behave.	This	isn’t	“faking	it	until	you	make	it.”	It’s	deeper	than	that.	This	is
about	 intellectually	 processing	 the	 ideas	 that	 will	 cause	 your	 emotions	 to	 shift,
which	will	then	lead	to	permanent	and	unconscious	changes	that	transform	you
into	the	attractive	male	you	can	be.

This	is	that	how-to	guide.

This	 book	 aims	 to	 arm	 you	 with	 the	 ideas	 and	 values	 that	 will	 form	 that
emotional	 foundation	 you	 never	 received	 in	 adolescence,	 to	 present	 the
masculine	model	you	and	I	missed	out	on.

And	 once	 you	 begin	 this	 internal	 shift,	 you’ll	 find	 that	 the	 social	 actions	 —
saying	 the	 right	 thing,	 knowing	 when	 to	 go	 for	 the	 kiss,	 knowing	 how	 to
approach	 a	 woman,	 etc.	 —	 they	 will	 all	 begin	 to	 fall	 into	 place,	 and	 fall	 into
place	in	a	more	profound	and	powerful	way	than	simply	memorizing	some	lines
or	following	some	sort	of	arbitrary	procedure.

The	beginning	of	this	book	is	very	theoretical.	It’s	the	big	picture	stuff.	I	do	this

because	 I	 think	 it’s	 important	 to	 lay	 a	 foundation	 to	 explain	 the	 realities	 of
attraction,	gender	behavior,	and	what	determines	your	value	on	the	dating	market
as	a	man.	As	the	book	goes	on	though,	it	becomes	more	technical	and	specific,
slowly	 honing	 in	 on	 necessary	 actions	 and	 habits.	 I	 believe	 it’s	 important	 to
explain	why	you	should	do	certain	actions	and	behaviors	before	asking	you	to	do
them.

Part	I	is	an	honest	look	at	female	attraction	based	on	scientific	research	and	the
realistic	consequences	of	that	research	in	modern	life.

Part	 II	 is	 an	 overview	 of	 the	 dating	 strategy	 that	 I	 recommend	 to	 all	 men	 who
come	to	me	for	help.	The	strategy	focuses	on	polarizing	reactions	from	women
to	 screen	 for	 the	 ones	 most	 receptive	 to	 your	 identity	 as	 soon	 as	 possible.	 We
also	 address	 rejection	 and	 how	 to	 use	 it	 to	 your	 advantage	 rather	 than	 let	 it
hinder	you.

This	 is	 a	 reality-based	 strategy,	 not	 based	 on	 fantasies	 or	 the	 frivolities	 of
wanting	to	sleep	with	every	woman	you	meet	or	dating	a	“perfect	10”	by	coming
up	with	scripts	of	pick	up	lines.	These	desires	are	rooted	in	insecurity	and	should
stay	 where	 they	 belong:	 in	 your	 dreams.	 Rather,	 Part	 II	 is	 a	 long-term	 strategy
built	to	take	a	man	from	“no	women	in	my	life”	to	“lots	of	amazing	women	in
my	life”	as	quickly	as	possible,	with	as	little	effort	as	possible.

Part	 III	 is	 the	 first	 part	 of	 our	 strategy	 and	 covers	 the	 first	 of	 the	 Three
Fundamentals	 laid	 out	 in	 Chapter	 6,	 building	 an	 enjoyable	 lifestyle	 and
becoming	an	attractive	man.	 The	steps	 laid	out	 in	this	part	will	be	specific	but
will	be	long-term	goals	with	long-term	benefits.

Part	 IV	 covers	 developing	 courage	 and	 becoming	 a	 man	 of	 action.	 Men	 are
expected	to	initiate	in	all	phases	of	courtship	(the	reasons	why	are	explained	in
Part	I)	and,	therefore,	a	man	who	is	hesitant,	anxious	or	afraid	of	initiating	will
not	get	very	far	with	most	women.	The	advice	laid	out	in	this	step	will	require
diligence	 but	 provide	 real	 and	 lasting	 change	 to	 those	 willing	 to	 dedicate
themselves.	These	steps	are	medium-term	goals	with	medium-term	benefits.

Finally,	Part	V	will	cover	the	nuts	and	bolts	of	communicating	more	effectively,
more	 attractively,	 more	 openly,	 and	 more	 sexually.	 The	 steps	 laid	 out	 in	 this
section	should	have	immediate,	short-term	benefits.

My	goal	is	to	provide	you	with	in-depth	perspective	into	your	emotions	and	how

you	operate	while	also	giving	you	practical	processes	for	improving	yourself	and
achieving	your	goals.

If	 you’re	 looking	 for	 a	 book	 full	 of	 “say	 this	 line	 and	 then	 execute	 touch-plan
X4Z-3,”	 then	 you’re	 going	 to	 be	 disappointed,	 and	 not	 only	 with	 this	 book,
you’re	 going	 to	 be	 disappointed	 with	 every	 book	 that	 gives	 advice	 like	 that
because	they	are	band-aid	solutions.

Until	you	learn	to	trust	your	own	actions	and	learn	to	pursue	women	with	your
own	unique	style	and	personality,	you	have	learned	absolutely	nothing.

This	 book	 aims	 to	 give	 you	 your	 first	 real	 education	 on	 women	 and	 attraction,
the	 education	 you	 should	 have	 received	 a	 long	 time	 ago,	 from	 a	 number	 of
sources	but	never	did.

And	I’ll	give	you	a	free	preview:	it	has	little	to	nothing	to	do	with	what	you’re
saying.	It	has	everything	to	do	with	body,	expression,	emotion,	and	movement.

A	couple	years	ago	I	was	in	Argentina.	There	I	made	one	of	the	most	important
discoveries	in	all	of	my	time	doing	this.	I	saw	a	girl	at	a	club	sitting	by	herself.
She	looked	upset.	And	when	I	approached	her,	she	didn’t	get	any	happier.	She
didn’t	speak	English	and	I	barely	spoke	any	Spanish	at	the	time.	She	didn’t	want
to	 dance	 and	 seemed	 uninterested	 in	 talking.	 She	 seemed	 shy	 and	 aloof,	 like
something	distant	invisible	was	occupying	her	and	despite	her	best	efforts,	she
didn’t	know	how	to	unburden	herself	of	it.

Eventually,	 through	 some	 tenacity,	 I	 got	 her	 to	 dance,	 and	 then	 to	 smile.	 And
what	I	discovered	over	the	next	week	was	how	unnecessary	words	actually	are
when	it	comes	to	seduction.

As	 she	 and	 I	 danced,	 we	 touched	 and	 played.	 I	 played	 hand	 games	 with	 her,
twirled	her,	made	funny	faces	and	communicated	with	fake	sign	language.	I	held
her,	 caressed	 her	 and	 touched	 her	 hair.	 We	 drew	 pictures	 on	 napkins	 for	 each
other.	When	I	put	my	arm	around	her	and	she	leaned	into	me	it	spoke	more	than
1,000	conversations.	We	moved	and	as	that	movement	drove	us	closer	together
physically,	we	came	together	emotionally	until	they	were	one	and	the	same	and
we	came.

Emerson	 once	 wrote,	 “What	 you	 do	 speaks	 so	 loudly	 I	 cannot	 hear	 what	 you
say.”	 Seduction	 is	 the	 interplay	 of	 emotions.	 Your	 movement,	 or	 lack	 of

movement,	reflects	and	alters	emotions,	not	the	words.	Words	are	the	side	effect.
Sex	is	the	side	effect.	The	game	is	emotions,	emotions	through	movement.	If	you
learn	anything	from	this	book,	let	that	be	it.

Our	 culture	 has	 become	 stationary.	 We	 spend	 our	 time	 sitting	 behind	 desks,
behind	 screens,	 and	 in	 cars.	 We	 don’t	 move	 like	 we	 used	 to	 and	 we	 don’t	 feel
like	we	used	to.

Over	the	course	of	this	book,	I’ll	invite	you	and	hopefully	inspire	you	to	move.
To	 get	up	out	of	that	chair,	 to	go	outside,	to	dare	to	feel,	to	 experiment	and	to
connect.	This	will	involve	getting	off	your	ass,	but	that’s	a	good	thing.	And	I	will
help	you	with	that.	And	if	you	promise	to	move,	then	I	promise	change.	Slowly,
your	looks	will	change,	your	words	will	change,	and	your	actions	 will	change.
And	hopefully,	maybe	something	amazing	will	happen.	Your	emotions	will	shift
and	 move	 and	 vibrate	 with	 them,	 and	 the	 women	 of	 the	 world	 will	 feel	 your
resonance	and	come	calling.

Part	I:	Reality

Chapter	1:
Non-Neediness

A	 man's	 attractiveness	 is	 inversely	 proportional	 to	 how	 needy	 he	 is.	 The	 less
needy	he	is,	the	more	attractive	he	will	be	to	women	on	average.	The	needier	he
is,	the	less	attractive	he	will	be	to	women	on	average.

Neediness	is	when	a	man	places	a	higher	priority	on	others’	perceptions	of	him
than	his	perception	of	himself.	A	needy	man’s	actions	and	words	will	therefore
be	primarily	motivated	by	impressing	and	winning	approval	from	others.	Non-
neediness	 is	 when	 a	 man	 places	 a	 higher	 priority	 on	 his	 own	 perception	 of
himself	 than	 the	 perceptions	 of	 others.	 A	 non-needy	 man’s	 actions	 and	 words
will	therefore	be	primarily	motivated	by	embodying	his	own	values	and	desires.

Neediness,	 therefore,	 infiltrates	 all	 behaviors	 because	 it	 is	 what	 inspires	 and
instigates	all	behaviors.	A	lack	of	neediness	also	infiltrates	all	behaviors	for	the
same	reason.	Because	it	underlies	all	of	your	actions	and	words,	to	be	non-needy
is	to	be	more	attractive,	in	every	way.	It	defines	and	resonates	in	everything	you
say	and	do,	the	way	you	stand,	the	way	you	smile,	the	jokes	you	tell,	the	people
you	associate	with,	the	car	you	drive,	the	wine	you	drink,	the	jacket	you	wear.

When	people	say	vague	things	like,	“I	like	the	way	he	carries	himself,”	or	“you
just	need	to	believe	in	yourself,”	or,	“he	just	has	‘it’,	whatever	‘it’	is,”	they	are
referring	to	a	man’s	lack	of	neediness.	It	exudes	from	him	in	everything	he	does.
Paradoxically,	 a	 man’s	 lack	 of	 need	 for	 attention	 and	 admiration	 is	 itself	 a
magnet	 for	 attention	 and	 admiration.	 A	 man’s	 comfort	 and	 acceptance	 of	 the
possibility	that	some	people	will	not	like	him	makes	people	like	him	even	more.
A	 man’s	 respect	 for	 differing	 opinions	 makes	 those	 around	 him	 want	 to	 agree
with	him	more.

A	needy	man	is	constantly	investing	in	the	perceptions	others	have	in	him.	He	is
being	extra	nice	and	friendly	when	he	doesn’t	want	to	be	because	he	believes	he
must	do	this	to	be	liked	and	loved.	He	is	buying	a	fancy	watch	and	season	tickets
to	the	local	sports	team	so	that	he	will	be	admired	and	loved.	He	is	coming	up
with	fake	compliments	or	pretending	to	be	a	bad	ass	because	he	thinks	it	will	get
him	attention	and	love.

A	 non-needy	 man	 may	 still	 do	 these	 behaviors	 —	 he	 may	 still	 buy	 the	 season
tickets	or	make	the	jokes.	But	his	intentions	are	different.	Whereas	a	needy	man
says	 and	 does	 these	 things	 for	 approval,	 the	 non-needy	 man	 does	 them	 simply
for	the	pleasure	of	doing.	The	needy	man	tries	to	control	what	others	think	and
feel	 more	 than	 what	 he	 thinks	 and	 feels	 himself.	 The	 non-needy	 man	 is	 more
concerned	 with	 controlling	 his	 own	 thoughts	 and	 feelings	 rather	 than	 the
thoughts	 and	 feelings	 of	 others.	 A	 needy	 man	 will	 be	 more	 invested	 in	 the
woman	 he	 is	 with	 than	 in	 himself	 –	 he	 will	 be	 more	 concerned	 about	 her
opinion,	 about	 him,	 about	 the	 weather,	 about	 everything	 other	 than	 what	 he
actually	thinks	and	feels.	A	non-needy	man	will	be	more	invested	in	himself	than
the	woman	he’s	with.

By	investment,	I	mean	the	degree	to	which	you	sacrifice/alter	your	own	thoughts,
feelings,	and	 motivations	for	 someone	else.	By	 less	 I	 mean	 that	 as	 a	 man,	 you
should	 not	 be	 willing	 to	 sacrifice	 your	 thoughts,	 feelings,	 and	 motivations	 for
someone	else	more	than	they	sacrifice	theirs	for	you.

That	may	sound	cold,	un-PC,	and	yes,	it	made	me	squirm	a	little	bit	when	I	first
realized	it.	But	it’s	true.

Think	 about	 it,	 for	 the	 majority	 of	 human	 history,	 men	 had	 few	 material
possessions	 by	 which	 women	 would	 judge	 their	 status.	 Back	 in	 the	 caveman
days,	there	were	no	outdoor	pools	and	tax	returns.	They	didn’t	have	brand	name
sandals	and	expensive	haircuts.	At	most,	one	man	had	a	little	bit	more	meat	to
share	than	the	next	guy.

Therefore,	 for	 the	 majority	 of	 human	 history,	 women	 watched	 men’s	 behavior.
Ask	 yourself	 what	 kind	 of	 behavior	 would	 indicate	 to	 a	 woman	 that	 a	 man	 is
high	 status	 and	 fit	 to	 raise	 her	 children?	 These	 are	 the	 men	 who	 would	 be
sexually	selected	over	the	course	of	hundreds	of	thousands	of	years.

Would	it	be	a	man	who	defers	to	all	of	the	other	men	around	him,	who	begs	the
women	to	be	with	him,	who	can’t	stand	up	for	himself	and	whose	emotions	are
dictated	 by	 those	 around	 him?	 Or	 would	 it	 be	 the	 man	 who	 controls	 his	 own
destiny,	is	unfazed	by	the	threats	others	may	pose	to	him	and	who	shrugs	it	off	if
he	pursues	a	woman	and	she	has	no	interest	in	him?

The	second	man	indicates	a	man	of	status.	If	you’re	at	the	top	of	the	food	chain,
you	have	no	reason	to	be	inhibited	or	to	defer	to	others	(unless	you	want	to).	If

you’re	 at	 the	 bottom	 of	 the	 food	 chain,	 your	 entire	 life	 will	 revolve	 around
deferring	to	others.

The	 high-status	 man	 displays	 non-neediness.	 The	 low-status	 man	 displays
neediness.

Neediness	 is	 not	 consciously	 calculated	 by	 women	 or	 people	 in	 general.	 I
guarantee	you	will	not	see	women	walking	around	with	neediness	scorecards.

Neediness	is	a	feeling.	It’s	intuited	by	women.	It’s	instinctual.	It’s	the	gag	reflex
she	 has	 when	 a	 guy	 calls	 her	 twelve	 too	 many	 times.	 It’s	 the	 distaste	 she	 has
when	he	seems	to	laugh	a	little	too	hard	at	her	jokes.	It’s	the	annoyance	she	has
when	 he	 seems	 to	 make	 every	 decision	 for	 her	 rather	 than	 letting	 her	 fend	 for
herself.

Women	unconsciously	detect	neediness	by	sensing	the	intentions	behind	a	man’s
behavior	 and	 words.	 It’s	 why	 women	 can	 often	 become	 turned	 off	 at	 the	 most
innocuous	 moment	 or	 by	 the	 most	 unimportant	 statement.	 Consciously,	 the
action	 or	 statement	 may	 seem	 harmless,	 but	 unconsciously,	 it	 conveyed
everything	they	need	to	know	about	your	status	and	that	is	this:	you	base	your
actions	on	a	constant	need	for	approval.

As	 you	 are	 probably	 aware,	 women	 can	 be	 needy	 as	 well.	 And	 although
neediness	is	a	turn-off	for	most	men,	it’s	not	the	complete	deal	breaker	that	it	is
for	women.

To	most	women,	a	man	with	no	neediness	is	like	a	woman	with	perfect	tits	and	a
gorgeously	 sculpted	 ass.	 To	 a	 woman,	 a	 man	 with	 a	 lot	 of	 neediness	 is	 like
having	the	worst	breath	and	missing	teeth.

It’s	 important	 to	 note	 that	 non-neediness	 doesn’t	 mean	 you	 should	 only	 care
about	 yourself.	 This	 is	 narcissism,	 and	 although	 it	 might	 get	 you	 laid,	 it	 is	 not
attractive	and	will	result	in	dysfunctional	relationships.

When	you	are	attracted	to	a	woman,	you	should	be	affected	by	her,	you	should
be	 invested	 in	 her.	 That’s	 the	 whole	 fun	 of	 it!	 That’s	 the	 reason	 we	 have
relationships	 in	 the	 first	 place,	 to	 be	 touched	 and	 moved	 by	 others.	 The
important	point	here	is	how	we	prioritize	other	people’s	perceptions	versus	our
own.	Which	is	more	important?	Hers	or	yours?

Highly	needy	men	will	end	up	in	relationships	sometimes,	but	only	with	highly
needy	women.	The	highly	needy	man	is	constantly	working	to	earn	a	woman’s
approval,	and	a	highly	needy	woman	is	constantly	in	need	of	a	man’s	approval.
So	 the	 two	 conspire	 together,	 usually	 with	 one	 creating	 drama/emotional
meltdowns	 and	 the	 other	 one	 endlessly	 fixing	 it.	 This	 relationship	 is	 toxic	 and
can	harm	each	person’s	self-worth.

Narcissistic	 men,	 or	 men	 who	 only	 care	 about	 themselves,	 will	 end	 up	 in
relationships	sometimes,	but	only	with	narcissistic	and	shallow	women.	Both	the
narcissistic	man	and	woman	will	view	each	other	merely	as	ornaments	to	adorn
their	 self-absorbed	 lives.	 These	 relationships	 also	 are	 toxic.	 And	 these
relationships	also	often	end	poorly.

Now	all	this	stuff	sounds	nice.	But	let’s	put	this	into	concrete,	real-world	terms.
Here	are	a	couple	examples.

James	is	a	nice	guy.	But	he	tends	to	be	needy	in	his	relationships	and	has	what
we	would	call	a	high	level	of	investment	with	any	woman	that	he	meets.

Whenever	he	dates	a	woman,	he	will	rearrange	his	entire	schedule	at	her	whim.
He	will	buy	her	gifts	and	spend	most	of	his	paycheck	on	the	nicest	dinners	for
her.	He’ll	forgo	plans	with	his	guy	friends	and	if	the	woman	he	dates	gets	angry,
he’ll	 sit	 patiently	 and	 listen	 to	 her	 vent	 all	 of	 her	 frustrations	 to	 him,	 agreeing
with	her	constantly	in	a	futile	desperation	that	she	may	feel	better.	Even	when	he
feels	 that	 she’s	 being	 irrational	 or	 treating	 him	 unfairly,	 he	 won’t	 say	 anything
because	he	doesn’t	want	her	to	be	upset	with	him.

As	a	result,	despite	caring	for	 him,	James’s	girlfriends	 rarely	respect	him.	And
sooner	or	later	—	usually	sooner	—	they	dump	him.	When	James	gets	dumped,
he	 becomes	 distraught	 and	 depressed.	 He’s	 often	 inconsolable	 and	 drinks	 too
much.	 Usually,	 he	 doesn’t	 feel	 better	 again	 until	 he	 meets	 another	 woman	 and
the	entire	cycle	repeats	itself.

Then	there’s	Jeff.	Jeff	has	been	successful	with	women	for	his	entire	life	and	has
a	very	low	level	of	investment	in	them	until	he’s	gotten	to	know	them	well.	Jeff
enjoys	 going	 out	 with	 his	 friends	 and	 pays	 no	 attention	 to	 whether	 the	 women
around	 him	 approve	 of	 him	 or	 not.	 At	 times,	 he	 says	 something	 weird	 or	 gets
rejected,	but	it	doesn’t	bother	him.

But	other	times	girls	become	quite	attracted	to	Jeff.	When	Jeff	notices,	if	he	finds

them	attractive,	he’ll	take	their	number	and	ask	them	out.	When	he	takes	them
out,	 he	 takes	 them	 to	 the	 park	 down	 the	 street	 from	 his	 flat.	 He	 then	 sits	 there
and	chats	with	them	for	a	while	and	if	he	doesn’t	like	them,	he’ll	excuse	himself
and	leave.	If	he	does	like	them,	he	might	take	them	to	get	ice	cream	or	check	out
a	show	with	him.	If	at	any	point	she	decides	she	doesn’t	like	him	and	leaves,	Jeff
doesn’t	 really	 mind.	 He	 figures	 that	 he	 wouldn’t	 have	 been	 happy	 with	 her
anyway,	so	why	change	himself	to	please	her?

Jeff	ends	up	sleeping	with	a	lot	of	women.	His	phone	is	constantly	ringing	with
texts	from	them,	but	he	only	answers	them	when	he	has	time	or	feels	like	it.	He’s
never	rude	or	nasty	to	them.	But	he	only	makes	time	for	the	ones	he	genuinely
enjoys	spending	time	with.

James	 has	 a	 high	 level	 of	 emotional	 investment	 in	 the	 women	 he	 meets	 and
dates.	He’s	not	confident.	He	is	needy.	He	immediately	enslaves	what	little	of	his
identity	he’s	aware	of	to	what	he	believes	will	make	women	like	him.

Jeff	has	a	low	level	of	investment.	He’s	content	with	his	life	and	proud	of	who	he
is.	 He	 is	 confident	 and	 non-needy.	 If	 a	 woman	 doesn’t	 appreciate	 that,	 then	 he
figures	he’s	better	off	without	her.

Women,	 as	 if	 with	 a	 sixth	 sense,	 detect	 Jeff’s	 lower	 level	 of	 emotional
investment	 because	 it	 informs	 all	 of	 his	 decisions	 and	 behaviors.	 Jeff	 is	 a	 high
self-esteem	 individual	 who	 takes	 care	 of	 himself	 and	 is	 therefore	 able	 to	 be
himself	 around	 others.	 James	 is	 not.	 Within	 moments	 of	 speaking	 to	 Jeff,	 and
often	 even	 before	 speaking	 to	 him,	 women	 sense	 that	 not	 only	 does	 he	 have	 a
strong	sense	of	identity,	he’s	also	unwilling	to	compromise	that	identity	for	her.
This	 sub-communicates	 his	 high	 status	 to	 them	 and	 elicits	 attraction.	 How	 Jeff
communicates	this	will	be	discussed	later	in	the	book.

Ask	women	and	they	will	tell	you	that	they	can	immediately	tell	if	a	man’s	“got
it,”	or	if	he	doesn’t.	They	don’t	know	what	“it”	is,	but	they	know	if	he	has	it	or
not.	 That	 “it”	 that	 they	 intuitively	 know	 in	 their	 gut	 the	 second	 they	 see	 him
walk,	hear	him	talk,	or	look	him	in	the	eye	is	his	level	of	investment	relative	her
and,	therefore,	his	lack	of	neediness.

If	 this	 all	 seems	 impractical	 so	 far,	 don’t	 worry.	 The	 majority	 of	 this	 book	 is
based	 on	 how	 to	 get	 “it”	 and	 how	 to	 convey	 “it”	 with	 women	 immediately,
regardless	of	what	you	actually	say	or	do.

The	Seduction	Process

Biologically,	women	have	a	lot	more	to	lose	than	men	when	it	comes	to	sex.	As
a	 result,	 they’ve	 had	 incentives	 to	 (usually)	 be	 pickier	 in	 choosing	 their	 sexual
partners.	Men,	on	the	other	hand,	have	historically	had	fewer	repercussions	for
promiscuity	and,	from	a	biological	point	of	view,	even	gain	some	advantages	by
being	promiscuous.

Whether	 it’s	 biological	 or	 cultural	 or	 some	 mixture	 of	 both,	 the	 fact	 is	 that
female	sexual	attraction	is	based	largely	in	feeling	comfortable	and	secure	with	a
man	she	meets.	Women	have	evolved	a	sexuality	that	is	more	psychological	than
physical,	 and	 that	 psychological	 need	 is	 rooted	 in	 the	 need	 for	 security	 and
connection.

This	is	why	status	is	based	on	behavior	and	not	simply	assets.	A	man	who	is	rich
in	assets	has	greater	potential	to	make	a	woman	feel	secure	and	comfortable,	but
if	 his	 behavior	 implies	 that	 he	 won’t,	 then	 she	 won’t	 be	 attracted	 to	 him.	 A
physically	 fit	 man	 will	 imply	 greater	 fitness	 for	 her	 children,	 but	 again,	 if	 his
behavior	implies	he	 will	be	incapable	or	incompetent	in	raising	them,	then	she
will	not	be	attracted	to	him.

Because	men	value	sex	more	than	women	at	the	beginning	of	a	relationship,	and
sexual	 opportunities	 are	 scarcer	 for	 men	 than	 women,	 women	 tend	 to	 be	 less
invested	and	more	confident	early	in	on	the	interaction.	When	a	man	approaches
her	 and	 induces	 her	 to	 become	 as	 invested	 in	 him	 as	 he	 is	 in	 her,	 this	 is	 the
process	of	seduction.	Sex	occurs	as	a	natural	side	effect	of	this	process.

Seduction	is	the	process	by	which	a	man	induces	a	woman	to	become	as	invested
in	him	as	he	is	in	her.

There	are	two	ways	for	seduction	to	happen:	1)	a	man	creates	the	perception	that
he	 is	 far	 less	 invested	 in	 her	 than	 he	 actually	 is	 (neediness	 disguised	 as	 non-
neediness),	and	2)	a	man	actually	is	less	invested	in	her	(genuine	non-neediness).

The	 first	 method	 (a	 man	 giving	 false	 impressions)	 occurs	 through	 what	 I	 call
“performance.”	 The	 vast	 majority	 of	 the	 dating	 advice	 out	 there	 for	 men	 (and
women)	 is	 performance-based	 advice	 —	 say	 this,	 act	 like	 this,	 don’t	 call	 her
back	right	away,	pretend	you	don’t	like	her,	make	these	jokes,	etc.

The	second	method	(a	man	demonstrating	less	investment)	is	a	passive	process

that	he	does	within	himself	and	that	permeates	every	aspect	of	his	behavior	over
the	long-term.	There’s	nothing	to	learn	or	memorize.	There	is	nothing	to	practice
or	 study.	 It	 only	 requires	 one	 to	 move	 his	 yardstick	 for	 success	 from	 external
goals	 (more	 dates,	 more	 sex)	 to	 internal	 goals	 (better	 relationships,	 more
emotional	 fulfillment,	 overall	 happiness).	 This	 book	 will	 lay	 out	 how	 this
internal	process	occurs	and	how	to	achieve	it	in	yourself.

Performance-based	 dating	 advice	 technically	 “works.”	 It’s	 just	 not	 fulfilling.
You’re	not	actually	solving	the	problem	(your	neediness);	you're	just	covering	it
up.	 A	 man	 who	 becomes	 successful	 through	 a	 series	 of	 performance-based
behaviors	may	have	sex,	but	he	is	setting	himself	up	for	terrible	and	unfulfilling
relationships	with	other	needy	women.

Let	 me	 take	 you	 through	 a	 few	 real-life	 examples	 of	 seduction	 and	 look	 at	 the
various	factors	going	on	in	each	one	from	a	neediness/investment	point	of	view.
These	 examples	 are	 real,	 but	 identities	 have	 been	 changed	 and	 minor	 details
altered.

When	Ryan	was	in	college,	he	was	a	leading	member	of	his	fraternity.	He	was	in
charge	of	organizing	his	house’s	parties.	He	was	a	gregarious	guy	and	liked	by
most	people.	At	one	of	these	parties,	he	met	Jane.	Jane	took	an	immediate	liking
to	Ryan	and	the	two	began	dating.	Ryan	would	organize	and	throw	his	parties,
Jane	 would	 come	 and	 bring	 her	 friends.	 They	 shared	 stories,	 experiences	 and
interests.	The	rest	of	college	went	on	like	this.

After	 they	 graduated,	 Ryan	 took	 a	 job	 at	 a	 bank.	 Jane	 got	 involved	 in	 a	 local
charity.	Ryan’s	social	network	disappeared	and	his	long	hours	at	work	killed	any
desire	 for	 him	 to	 go	 out	 and	 make	 new	 friends.	 He	 began	 to	 spend	 more	 and
more	 time	 with	 Jane.	 They	 usually	 just	 watched	 movies	 and	 shared	 a	 bottle	 of
wine.

As	time	went	on,	Jane	became	more	and	more	involved	in	her	charity	events	and
began	 traveling	 to	 help	 with	 fundraisers.	 Ryan	 would	 spend	 this	 time	 alone
watching	TV	or	maybe	grabbing	a	beer	with	one	of	his	old	buddies,	but	it	wasn’t
the	 same.	 After	 another	 year,	 Ryan	 would	 openly	 complain	 to	 Jane	 about	 her
trips.	Jane	obviously	sympathized	with	Ryan,	but	she	felt	pressured	and	resented
him	for	it.	They	began	to	fight	more	often.	Ryan	gained	weight.	Jane	spent	more
time	working	away	from	home.

Ryan	decided	to	plan	a	lavish	trip	for	the	two	of	them	to	the	Caribbean.	He	could
use	 the	 much-needed	 time	 away	 from	 work,	 and	 it	 would	 infuse	 their
relationship	 with	 the	 excitement	 and	 passion	 that	 it	 sorely	 needed.	 The	 trip
returned	 the	 romance	 to	 their	 relationship	 briefly.	 But	 upon	 returning	 home,
reality	began	to	set	in	once	again.	Within	a	few	months	it	was	back	to	business
as	usual:	him	overworked	and	irritable,	her	distancing	herself	and	traveling.

Ryan	 began	 talking	 about	 marriage.	 Jane	 was	 hesitant.	 She	 stated	 that	 her	 job
was	 getting	 busier	 and	 she	 didn’t	 know	 how	 much	 she’d	 be	 around	 to	 plan	 a
wedding.	 Ryan	 had	 been	 saving	 much	 of	 his	 money	 to	 buy	 her	 a	 ring.	 Jane
lamented	that	they	were	still	young	and	hadn’t	 really	experienced	much	of	life
yet.	Secretly,	in	the	back	of	her	mind,	she	couldn’t	shake	the	feeling	that	Ryan
was	 terrified	 of	 just	 that:	 experiencing	 life,	 and	 marrying	 her	 was	 just	 another
way	for	him	to	escape	it.

Dejected,	 a	 few	 weeks	 later	 Ryan	 began	 to	 complain	 that	 Jane	 spent	 too	 much
time	with	her	friends	and	at	work.	Indeed,	Jane	had	been	staying	at	work	until
way	into	the	night,	even	on	days	when	she	didn’t	have	to.	Ryan	began	pressuring
Jane	 to	 move	 in	 together,	 but	 again	 she	 resisted,	 this	 time	 fervently.	 Ryan
exploded,	he	had	been	giving	up	everything	for	her	the	past	few	years	and	she
had	been	nothing	but	ungrateful.	She	retorted	that	Ryan	had	been	suffocating	her
with	his	demands	for	attention	and	affection.	Jane	dumped	him	on	the	spot.

There’s	 a	 good	 chance	 the	 above	 story	 sounds	 familiar	 to	 you.	 You	 or	 one	 of
your	friends	or	family	members	have	probably	gone	through	the	same	process	as
Ryan:	 meet	 girl	 in	 a	 situation	 of	 low	 emotional	 investment	 and	 low	 neediness,
entered	 relationship	 with	 said	 girl,	 gradually	 invested	 more	 and	 more	 while
letting	 the	 rest	 of	 your	 personal	 life	 slip	 away,	 until	 girl	 leaves	 you	 and	 dates
some	other	guy	who	is	less	invested	than	she	is	again.

Here’s	another	story	that	may	sound	familiar	to	you.

Daniel	is	24	years	old	and	trying	to	get	over	a	three-year	dry	spell.	It’s	the	first
time	he’s	pursued	women	since	his	only	girlfriend	dumped	him	three	years	ago.

Daniel	goes	out	to	a	bar	one	night	and	approaches	Stacy.	Daniel	approaches	her
with	what	seems	like	an	innocuous	question	about	drunk	guys	getting	in	fights.
She	responds	and	he	follows	it	up	with	a	number	of	quirky	lines	to	soon	get	her
laughing.

These	 are	 lines	 and	 questions	 Daniel	 learned	 from	 reading	 a	 pick	 up	 book	 on
women.	 Daniel	 has	 been	 practicing	 the	 tactics	 for	 a	 while	 and	 has	 recently
become	 proficient	 at	 using	 them.	 After	 facing	 countless	 rejections,	 he’s	 finally
able	to	get	girls’	phone	numbers	and	even	a	few	dates.

He	continues	to	talk	to	Stacy	throughout	the	night	about	pre-ordained	topics	he’s
comfortable	 with.	 He’s	 able	 to	 punctuate	 each	 lull	 with	 tried	 and	 tested	 jokes
he’s	used	dozens	of	times.	Every	time,	Stacy	laughs	on	cue.	He	touches	her	on
the	arm	just	like	he	read	to	do,	and	she	touches	him	back.	She’s	interested.

A	week	later,	after	some	fun	texting,	Stacy	meets	up	with	Daniel	for	a	date.	Once
again,	 Daniel	 executes	 everything	 he’s	 learned:	 stick	 to	 topics	 about	 her
passions,	move	her	from	venue	to	venue,	never	sits	across	from	her	but	next	to
her,	use	a	planned	excuse	to	get	her	back	to	his	place,	etc.

There	 are	 hiccups	 along	 the	 way,	 but	 it	 all	 more	 or	 less	 works.	 Stacy	 seems
genuinely	attracted	and	when	Daniel	finally	works	up	the	nerve	to	kiss	her,	she
kisses	back	enthusiastically.

Daniel	is	ecstatic.	He	feels	like	months	of	hard	work	have	finally	paid	off.

The	 second	 date	 goes	 similarly.	 Daniel	 manages	 to	 get	 Stacy	 back	 to	 his
apartment	where,	fumbling	through	his	excitement,	he	has	sex	with	her.

Daniel	 is	 on	 cloud	 nine,	 delirious	 with	 joy	 and	 drunk	 on	 validation.	 He	 jumps
online	 to	 talk	 to	 his	 best	 friend	 and	 tell	 him	 all	 of	 the	 clever	 lines	 he	 said	 and
how	much	she	likes	him.

Little	does	Daniel	realize	that	it	wasn’t	his	lines	and	tricks	that	Stacy	fell	for,	it
was	 the	 endearing	 way	 he	 laughed	 at	 himself	 whenever	 he	 was	 self-conscious.
She	thought	it	was	cute	and	it	reminded	her	of	her	first	boyfriend.	She	also	was
in	a	lonely	stretch	of	her	life	and	wanted	to	feel	needed	by	someone	and	the	fact
that	Daniel	was	working	so	hard	for	her	approval	flattered	her	and	made	her	feel
a	little	less	alone.

At	least	for	a	little	while.

Daniel	and	Stacy	see	each	other	a	few	more	times	over	the	following	weeks,	but
something	changes.	Since	he’s	already	had	sex	with	her,	Daniel	stops	running	his
lines	and	tactics	that	he	learned.	He	slowly	reverts	back	to	 his	normal	 self,	his

needy	self:	desperate	for	attention	and	approval.

It	 begins	 subtly	 with	 him	 agreeing	 with	 everything	 she	 says,	 followed	 by	 a
sudden	inability	to	come	up	with	new	and	interesting	topics	of	conversation.	It
turns	out	he	spends	most	of	his	time	watching	TV	and	playing	video	games,	and
there’s	not	a	whole	lot	to	talk	about	on	that	front.	What	used	to	be	vibrant	and
hilarious	bantering	has	now	turned	into	Stacy	showing	up,	saying	whatever	she
wants	 and	 Daniel	 more	 or	 less	 agreeing	 with	 her	 until	 it’s	 time	 to	 have	 sex	 —
which	is	now	bad,	uninteresting	sex.

But	Stacy	is	changing	too.	She’s	starting	to	realize	that	she	used	sex	as	a	way	to
make	herself	feel	less	lonely	and	that	perhaps	she	was	way	too	invested	in	a	guy
she	actually	didn’t	have	anything	in	common	with.	But	rather	than	recognize	that
she	 made	 a	 mistake,	 she	 continues	 to	 see	 Daniel	 out	 of	 guilt	 and	 for	 fear	 of
feeling	like	a	slut.

One	day,	Daniel	texts	Stacy	about	meeting	up	with	him	that	weekend.	She	was
busy	studying	for	a	test	that	night	and	didn’t	reply.	Stacy	was	actually	busy,	she
tells	herself.	What	she	doesn’t	admit	to	herself	is	that	she	could	have	made	time
if	she	wanted.

Daniel	begins	to	get	insecure	about	why	Stacy’s	not	responding.	He	gets	online
and	asks	his	friend	for	advice.	His	friend	says	that	he	needs	to	text	her	something
really	crazy	to	get	her	to	pay	attention	and	like	him	again.

The	next	day,	after	her	test,	Stacy	sees	her	phone	and	notices	four	new	texts	from
Daniel.	The	first	one	is	casual,	but	each	one	gets	progressively	weirder	and	more
nonsensical.	Stacy	is	turned	off	—	it’s	that	neediness	rearing	its	ugly	head	again.
But	again,	out	of	guilt	and	unsure	of	how	to	end	things	due	to	her	own	neediness,
she	 decides	 to	 pretend	 the	 texts	 didn’t	 happen	 and	 agrees	 to	 meet	 Daniel	 that
weekend,	 even	 though	 at	 this	 point,	 it	 feels	 more	 like	 an	 obligation	 and	 not
something	she’s	excited	to	do.

But	 Daniel	 is	 not	 so	 easily	 fooled.	 He’s	 not	 about	 to	 reward	 Stacy’s	 “bad
behavior”	 by	 immediately	 hanging	 out	 with	 her.	 He	 was	 taught	 in	 his	 pick	 up
books	 to	 never	 let	 the	 girl	 set	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 relationship.	 So	 he	 waits	 a	 few
hours	and	then	texts	Stacy	that	she’s	too	late	and	he’s	already	made	other	plans
with	other	people.	She	finds	this	strange.	Daniel	had	texted	her	four	times,	but
truthfully	she	feels	somewhat	relieved.	She	can	move	on	with	her	life.

The	following	week	Daniel	texts	Stacy	and	coldly	insinuates	that	he’s	ready	to
see	her	now,	if	she’s	willing	to	work	for	it.	The	condescension	and	disrespectful
tone	pisses	Stacy	off	and	she	doesn’t	respond.

Two	days	later	Daniel,	drunk	and	confused	about	why	Stacy	doesn’t	want	to	see
him	anymore,	sends	a	sappy	text	saying	that	he	really	likes	her	and	really	wants
to	see	her	again	and	doesn’t	know	why	she	doesn’t	like	him	anymore.

Completely	 confused	 and	 turned	 off,	 Stacy	 replies	 that	 he’s	 a	 nice	 guy	 but	 she
just	 wants	 to	 be	 friends,	 even	 though	 she	 has	 no	 intention	 of	 ever	 seeing	 him
again.

I	can	tell	you	that	I’ve	seen	both	of	these	stories	play	out	over	and	over	and	over
again,	in	hundreds	of	different	forms	between	hundreds	of	different	people.

Guy	 meets	 girl.	 Guy	 shows	 less	 investment	 in	 girl	 than	 himself,	 sex	 and/or
relationship	 occurs,	 guy	 becomes	 more	 invested	 in	 girl	 than	 himself,	 sex	 stops
and/or	relationship	falls	apart.

The	 first	 story	 is	 an	 example	 of	 why	 it’s	 important	 to	 continue	 to	 invest	 in
oneself	 even	 as	 life	 changes	 occur	 and	 the	 relationship	 goes	 on.	 It’s	 the	 only
long-term	solution	to	keep	long-term	relationships	stable	and	happy.

Ryan’s	relationship	with	Jane	failed	because	after	he	graduated	from	college,	he
lost	 and	 never	 regained	 the	 great	 aspects	 of	 his	 identity	 that	 made	 him	 so
attractive	to	Jane	in	the	first	place	—	his	social	network,	his	joy	and	spontaneity,
the	cool	group	activities	he	planned.	As	he	got	cornered	into	a	job	he	hated	and
lost	 his	 social	 circle,	 he	 began	 leaning	 on	 her	 more	 and	 more	 to	 define	 his
identity	for	himself.	He	invested	less	in	himself	and	more	and	more	in	her.

Meanwhile,	Jane	flourished	after	graduation,	quickly	falling	into	a	job	she	was
passionate	 about	 and	 good	 at.	 She	 made	 new	 friends	 and	 began	 traveling	 and
having	new	experiences	on	her	own.	As	Jane	became	less	invested	in	Ryan	for
her	identity,	Ryan	became	more	invested	in	Jane,	growing	needier	and	needier.
Eventually,	the	dynamic	of	investment	shifted	and	the	relationship	toppled	over.

Daniel’s	experience	was	different.	Daniel’s	story	is	a	quintessential	example	of
why	 pick	 up	 lines,	 routines,	 value	 tactics	 and	 the	 like	 are	 only	 short-term
solutions.	 Daniel	 was	 needy	 and	 highly-invested	 in	 Stacy’s	 affection	 from	 the
start.	All	Daniel	did	was	use	techniques	and	lines	to	trick	Stacy	into	thinking	he

was	far	more	confident	and	less	invested	than	he	actually	was.

And	it	worked,	for	a	bit.	But	the	irony	here	is	that	what	attracted	her	the	most
was	 not	 Daniel’s	 lines,	 but	 the	 authenticity	 of	 him	 bumbling	 through	 them	 to
impress	 her.	 Stacy	 found	 it	 endearing	 and	 genuine	 and	 was	 in	 an	 unconfident
place	herself	at	the	time.	She	was	in	a	place	in	her	life	where	she	wanted	to	feel
needed	and	powerful.	She	also	found	the	idiosyncrasies	of	his	personality	to	be
cute,	as	they	reminded	her	of	her	first	boyfriend.	So	she	slept	with	him.

But	as	Daniel’s	lines	and	techniques	ran	out,	the	true	level	of	investment	became
more	 and	 more	 clear.	 Daniel’s	 behavior	 became	 erratic	 and	 it	 disgusted	 Stacy,
causing	her	to	cut	him	off	in	some	ugly	text	exchanges.

But	a	lot	of	men	who	follow	this	type	of	dating	advice	don’t	even	make	it	that
far.	 They	 may	 conjure	 the	 impression	 of	 status	 for	 only	 an	 hour	 or	 even	 a	 few
minutes	before	they	falter.	Such	are	the	stresses	of	performance.

Learning	 techniques	 and	 pick	 up	 lines	 without	 doing	 genuine,	 identity-level
work	 in	 order	 to	 permanently	 decrease	 your	 neediness	 ends	 up	 only	 being	 a
band-aid	 solution.	 It	 provides	 a	 short,	 temporary	 relief	 from	 an	 otherwise
permanent	problem.	It	causes	more	stress.	And	it	ultimately	makes	us	feel	worse
about	ourselves.

Overcoming	 neediness	 is	 not	 about	 learning	 what	 to	 say	 or	 new	 things	 to	 do.
Overcoming	your	neediness	comes	through	a	change	in	your	mindset,	your	self-
perception,	and	your	self-respect.	It's	as	simple	as	just	changing	your	mind	about
women.

Take	a	moment	to	consider…

…That	 before	 meeting	 a	 woman,	 instead	 of	 worrying	 whether	 or	 not	 she	 will
like	you,	you	could	wonder	if	you	will	like	her.

…That	 instead	 of	 feeling	 the	 need	 to	 impress	 her,	 you	 could	 wonder	 if	 she
impresses	you.

…That	instead	of	sitting	there	silently	wondering	what	to	say	next	to	make	her
like	you,	you	could	sit	there	silently	wondering	what	she	will	say	to	make	you
like	her.

…That	instead	of	waiting	around	for	her	to	call,	you	could	find	something	else
to	do	while	she	waits	for	your	call.

…That	 instead	 of	 worrying	 if	 you’re	 tall	 enough	 or	 good-looking	 enough	 or
skinny	 enough,	 you	 could	 decide	 whether	 they’re	 too	 superficial	 to	 recognize
your	great	qualities.

…That	instead	of	trying	to	come	up	with	the	perfect	date,	you	could	decide	that
a	woman	who	really	likes	you	for	you	doesn’t	need	a	perfect	date.

…That	instead	of	looking	for	a	conversation	she’ll	enjoy,	you	could	talk	about
something	you	enjoy	and	see	if	she	takes	interest.

…That	instead	of	looking	for	her	approval,	you	could	decide	whether	or	not	to
give	yours.

…That	instead	of	getting	upset	about	why	she	doesn’t	want	to	be	with	you,	you
could	decide	that	it	means	you	probably	wouldn’t	want	to	be	with	her.

it’s	 called	 having
This	 may	 all	 sound	 a	 bit	 selfish.	 But,
strong	 boundaries	 and	 high	 self-esteem.	 It’s	 called	 being	 non-needy	 and	 an
attractive	man.

in	 fact,

Only	making	time	for	people	who	make	time	for	you.	Only	being	interested	in
dating	people	who	are	interested	in	dating	you.	Worrying	about	what	will	make
you	happy	instead	of	what	will	make	someone	else	happy.	Looking	for	a	person
who	meets	your	needs	instead	of	trying	to	always	meet	theirs.	Changing	yourself
to	become	who	you	want	to	be,	not	what	you	think	women	want	you	to	be.

Because,	ironically,	that	is	what	women	want	you	to	be:	a	man	who	wants	to	be
who	he	wants	to	be.

Women	are	attracted	to	a	man	they	can	respect,	to	a	man	they	can	trust.	If	you’re
constantly	 looking	 for	 approval	 for	 what	 to	 say	 and	 how	 to	 feel,	 how	 could
anyone	respect	or	trust	you?

You	are	what	attracts	(or	repels)	others	—	not	the	words,	not	the	strategies.	If	you
aren’t	happy	with	the	results	you	get,	then	it’s	time	to	improve	you.

I	 don’t	 care	 how	 hot	 she	 is.	 Is	 she	 good	 enough	 for	 you?	 Does	 she	 have

integrity?	Standards?	Is	she	smart,	personable,	caring?	Are	you	ready	to	leave	on
a	dime	if	she	offends	you	or	breaks	your	trust?

If	not,	that’s	probably	why	you’re	not	with	her	in	first	place.

The	 only	 real	 dating	 advice	 is	 self-improvement.	 Work	 on	 yourself.	 Conquer
your	 anxieties.	 Resolve	 your	 shame.	 Take	 care	 of	 yourself	 and	 those	 who	 are
important	to	you.

Love	yourself.	Otherwise	no,	one	else	will.

Narcissism	and	Overcompensation

When	 a	 man	 has	 spent	 his	 entire	 life	 needy	 and	 highly	 invested,	 doing	 the
legitimate	work	to	transform	himself	into	a	confident,	attractive	man	is	not	easy.

To	 become	 non-needy,	 a	 man	 must	 develop	 self-respect,	 a	 healthy	 sense	 of
boundaries,	social	competence,	and	healthy	life	habits.	It’s	often	a	painful	long-
term	process	that	entails	quite	a	bit	of	introspection,	questioning,	doubt,	anger,
frustration,	lifestyle	changes,	and	so	on.

But	there	is	a	shortcut.	And	that	shortcut	is	to	objectify	women,	to	treat	them	as
objects	or	trophies	to	be	accumulated	or	paraded	around	for	others.

As	 I	 said	 earlier,	 some	 men	 try	 to	 fake	 non-neediness	 through	 performance.
We’ve	already	seen	how	this	ultimately	fails	in	the	long	run.

But	 other	 men	 overcompensate.	 It’s	 so	 hard	 for	 them	 to	 let	 go	 of	 what	 others
think	of	them	and	to	stand	up	for	themselves.	So	they	go	the	complete	opposite
direction	 and	 decide	 to	 only	 care	 about	 themselves.	 They	 become	 narcissistic
and	self-serving,	they	view	their	relationships	as	vehicles	to	get	specific	benefits
and	are	unconcerned	with	the	needs	of	the	person	they’re	with.

Needy	 men	 only	 know	 how	 to	 care	 about	 what	 others	 want,	 even	 if	 it	 harms
themselves.	 Non-needy	 men	 look	 for	 that	 intersection	 where	 they	 can	 get	 both
their	own	needs	and	their	partner’s	needs	met.	Narcissistic	men	overcompensate
and	decide	to	only	pursue	getting	their	own	needs	met.

Narcissistic	men	usually	do	this	by	conjuring	up	all	sorts	of	false	beliefs	about

the	 inferiority	 or	 difference	 of	 women	 —	 how	 women	 are	 incapable	 of
rationality,	how	they’re	“hypergamous,”	how	they	manipulate	men,	how	women
are	destined	to	be	dominated	and	controlled.

It’s	all	bullshit,	but	these	men	use	it	as	a	justification	for	their	overcompensation
to	put	them	at	ease	in	their	own	self-absorption.

Men	who	go	narcissistic	act	like	they’re	more	important	than	anybody	else.	They
are	 aggressive,	 insensitive,	 and	 demanding.	 They	 are	 self-serving	 and	 don’t
handle	rejection	or	loss	well.	Some	of	these	men	even	end	up	becoming	abusive.

But	 the	 narcissist’s	 façade	 is	 weak	 and	 transparent.	 The	 truth	 is	 that	 the	 man’s
narcissism	 is	 wielded	 as	 a	 sort	 of	 shield	 to	 protect	 the	 sensitive	 neediness
underneath.	 See,	 narcissistic	 men	 are	 still	 desperate	 for	 the	 approval	 of	 others.
They’ve	 just	 taken	 a	 counterintuitive	 route	 to	 getting	 it:	 their	 own	 self-
aggrandizement.	Whereas	a	needy	man	will	play	at	being	meek	and	unimportant
in	order	to	get	approval	from	others,	the	narcissist	proclaims	his	own	greatness
to	get	approval	from	others.

When	a	woman	becomes	merely	another	conquest,	a	number,	something	to	treat
like	a	trophy	or	a	toy,	it	can	be	extremely	easy	to	assert	yourself	around	them,	to
prioritize	your	own	values	and	beliefs	over	theirs,	to	risk	rejection	around	them,
and	 to	 dominate	 any	 perspective	 they	 might	 have	 —	 all	 attractive	 confident
traits,	merely	expressed	in	horrible	ways.

Narcissism	is	also	taught	to	men	as	a	form	of	dating	advice.	Much	of	the	dating
advice	 out	 there	 advises	 men	 to	 be	 selfish,	 to	 be	 “alpha,”	 to	 be	 dominant	 and
aggressive	 and	 to	 ignore	 women’s	 objections	 or	 rejections,	 to	 pursue	 what	 you
want	no	matter	what	and	take	it	through	pure	persistence	and	aggression.	It	will
justify	this	advice	with	all	sorts	of	explanations	that	women	don’t	actually	know
what	they	want,	that	they’re	just	“testing”	you,	that	they	actually	want	it	but	they
can’t	say	it,	and	so	on.

Narcissism	is	also	often	promoted	to	men	by	other	men	growing	up,	especially	in
highly	“macho”	cultures	(Latin	America,	the	Middle	East,	East	Asian,	etc.).	Men
are	 often	 raised	 by	 other	 narcissistic	 men	 who	 only	 found	 their	 way	 through
relationships	 through	 self-aggrandizement	 and	 selfishness,	 and	 so	 they	 seek	 to
pass	these	traits	onto	their	sons.

Narcissism	in	a	relationship	is	built	on	the	idea	of	always	being	dominant	or	in

control.	 It	 is	 a	 nebulous	 mixture	 of	 selfishness,	 assertiveness,	 and	 domination
that	 is	 achieved	 not	 through	 investing	 more	 in	 oneself,	 but	 by	 minimizing	 the
importance	of	others.

This	 strategy	 is	 ultimately	 self-sabotaging	 then.	 Narcissistic	 men	 see	 seduction
and	 relationships	 as	 another	 competition	 to	 be	 dominated	 and	 won,	 not	 as	 a
collaboration	 to	 be	 enjoyed.	 If	 the	 goal	 is	 to	 cultivate	 highly	 enriching
relationships	 that	 add	 to	 one’s	 life,	 then	 minimizing	 the	 importance	 of	 those
around	 you	 in	 order	 to	 attract	 them	 to	 you	 makes	 the	 resulting	 relationships
unfulfilling	and	superficial.

Narcissistic	 men	 end	 up	 with	 narcissistic	 and/or	 highly	 needy	 women.
Narcissistic	 women	 will	 use	 the	 narcissistic	 man	 to	 aggrandize	 themselves,	 to
put	 themselves	 up	 and	 fulfill	 their	 own	 egotistical	 goals.	 Needy	 women	 will
tolerate	a	narcissistic	man’s	poor	treatment	of	them	because	the	needy	woman	is
constantly	in	search	of	a	feeling	of	greatness	herself.

And	the	sad	thing	is,	it	works	—	not	on	all	women,	not	even	on	most	women,
but	 it	 will	 work	 on	 women	 who	 have	 no	 confidence,	 who	 expect	 to	 be	 treated
like	shit,	and	who	treat	men	like	shit	in	return.	Women	with	any	self-worth	will
pass	 up	 on	 a	 narcissistic	 man	 in	 a	 heartbeat.	 She	 sees	 right	 through	 his	 macho
veneer.	 But	 low	 self-esteem	 women,	 particularly	 women	 with	 truckloads	 of
emotional	problems	or	a	history	of	abuse,	will	gladly	throw	themselves	onto	the
narcissistic	man	and	bring	him	down	with	them.

So	 yeah,	 being	 narcissistic	 and	 overcompensating	 works.	 But	 it	 leads	 to
unpleasant,	 shallow,	 and	 superficial	 interactions,	 constant	 headaches	 dealing
with	 women	 who	 you	 don’t	 actually	 even	 really	 like	 and	 who	 probably	 don’t
even	actually	like	you,	women	regretting	having	sex	with	you,	and	emotionally
unstable	girls	who	bother	you	constantly.	It’s	like	swimming	in	the	shallow	end
of	 the	 pool	 —	 yeah,	 you’re	 swimming,	 but	 it’s	 not	 nearly	 as	 rewarding	 as	 the
deep	end,	and	there’s	piss	everywhere.

Narcissism	comes	in	many	varieties	but	usually	boils	down	to	this:	focusing	on
your	 own	 wants	 and	 desires	 to	 the	 point	 of	 imposing	 them	 onto	 others.
Exaggerate	your	dominance	and	boast	of	your	strength.	Accept	no	wrongdoing.
Admit	no	faults.	Blame	others	for	your	problems.	Go	out	of	your	way	to	make
others	feel	smaller	so	that	you	appear	bigger.

The	 problem	 with	 narcissism	 is	 that	 it	 defines	 itself	 by	 getting	 what	 it	 wants
from	others.	A	man	who	is	narcissistic	only	feels	non-needy	if	he’s	dominating
somebody	 else	 and	 if	 someone	 else	 is	 giving	 him	 what	 he	 wants.	 And	 in	 that
subtle	way,	he	is	therefore	more	invested	in	others	than	he	is	in	himself.	He	is
therefore	still	needy	and	unattractive.

To	give	an	example,	if	a	non-needy	man	meets	a	woman	who	rejects	him	or	is
not	interested	in	him,	he	will	assume	that	is	was	either	an	incompatibility	or	that
it	was	just	not	the	right	situation.	Either	way,	he	will	see	it	as	the	right	thing	to
have	happened.	His	life	will	go	on.

But	when	a	narcissistic	man	is	rejected,	he	becomes	angry	and	hurt.	He	blames
the	woman	for	not	seeing	his	greatness.	He	calls	her	stupid	or	selfish	or	shallow
because	she’s	not	willing	to	give	him	what	he	–	a	random	guy	talking	to	her	–
wants.

It’s	 just	 another	 form	 of	 performance	 —	 he	 acts	 as	 if	 he’s	 in	 control,	 but	 his
desperation	to	be	in	control	is	due	to	insecurity.	A	non-needy	man	doesn’t	try	to
control	 what	 women	 feel	 about	 him.	 Rather	 he	 tries	 to	 control	 what	 he	 feels
about	certain	women.	He	understands	that	the	world	isn’t	about	him	and	that	all
he	 can	 control	 is	 himself	 and	 his	 own	 actions.	 He’s	 not	 bothered	 when	 things
don’t	go	his	way	or	when	people	don’t	recognize	him	as	being	amazing	because
he	 already	 feels	 amazing	 himself.	 He	 doesn’t	 need	 their	 approval	 and	 their
disapproval	doesn’t	faze	him	from	his	mission.

Narcissistic	men	are	often	serial	players,	guys	who	obsessively	seek	out	casual
sex	and	not	only	regard	the	women	they	sleep	with	poorly,	but	treat	them	poorly
as	well.

Let’s	do	another	example:

Roy	was	a	nice	guy	all	through	college.	He	was	a	geeky	science	guy	but	adored
by	 all	 of	 the	 girls	 he	 hung	 out	 with.	 Roy	 adored	 them	 as	 well,	 but	 in	 a	 sexual
way.	Unfortunately,	whenever	Roy	worked	up	the	nerve	to	say	something,	they
always	told	him	they	just	wanted	to	be	his	friend.	All	the	while,	Roy	would	sit
there	listening	to	his	female	friends	complain	about	their	horrible	and	insensitive
boyfriends.	All	Roy	could	think	was,	“But	I	care	about	you,	I’m	sensitive,	and
I’m	right	in	front	of	you.	Why	can’t	you	see	that?”

Needless	 to	 say,	 Roy’s	 female	 friends	 never	 came	 around.	 Despite	 all	 of	 the

waiting	 and	 hoping	 and	 placating,	 they	 always	 moved	 on	 to	 the	 next	 guy	 —
usually	a	guy	they	had	just	met.

Eventually,	 when	 Roy	 was	 25	 years	 old,	 he	 landed	 his	 first	 girlfriend:	 a
depressive	and	slightly	overweight	grad	student	who	worked	in	his	lab.	Despite
her	 obvious	 shortcomings,	 he	 was	 smitten	 with	 her.	 But	 his	 girlfriend’s
emotional	 instability	 eventually	 got	 the	 best	 of	 both	 of	 them.	 After	 a	 turbulent
year	together,	they	broke	up.

Roy’s	anger	boiled	over.	He	was	sick	of	being	walked	over	and	kicked	around.
He	 was	 sick	 of	 being	 ignored	 and	 hurt.	 His	 entire	 life,	 women	 had	 never	 paid
attention	 to	 him	 sexually,	 and	 the	 one	 who	 finally	 did	 wasn’t	 satisfied.	 Roy
decided	he	had	had	enough,	that	it	was	time	to	put	himself	first.	It	was	time	to
put	his	own	needs	first.	He	saw	how	other	men	had	been	assholes	to	his	female
friends	and	slept	with	them,	so	he	decided	that	he	would	do	the	same.

Roy	quickly	found	that	he	was	comfortable	dishing	out	insults	and	teases	toward
the	 women	 he	 talked	 to.	 It	 felt	 like	 vindication	 for	 a	 lifetime	 of	 emotional
negligence.	Some	women	were	offended,	but	strangely	this	made	Roy	feel	even
more	powerful	and	motivated	him	to	go	out	and	meet	even	more	women.

Soon,	to	Roy’s	surprise,	some	of	these	girls	actually	became	attracted	to	him.	He
took	them	home	and	slept	with	them.	At	first,	the	girls	were	drunk	and	ugly,	but
slowly	and	surely,	as	Roy	became	more	comfortable	in	his	new	player	persona,
the	girls	became	more	attractive.

Some	of	the	girls	Roy	slept	with	were	genuinely	intrigued	by	Roy	and	wanted	to
get	to	know	him	better.	Roy	would	toy	with	these	women,	play	phone	tag	with
them,	use	them	for	sex	a	few	more	times	and	then	invent	some	sort	of	conflict	or
blame	 her	 for	 something	 she	 didn’t	 do	 as	 an	 excuse	 to	 not	 see	 her	 anymore.
These	 women	 quickly	 got	 the	 picture	 that	 Roy	 was	 neither	 stable	 nor	 an
enjoyable	person	to	spend	time	with,	so	they	moved	on.

Other	 girls	 Roy	 slept	 with	 weren’t	 as	 intrigued	 with	 him	 as	 they	 were
emotionally	desperate	for	some	sort	of	male	validation.

Some	 of	 these	 women	 simply	 wanted	 to	 be	 validated	 by	 having	 sex.	 In	 which
case,	Roy	fucked	them	and	never	heard	from	them	again.

But	 for	 many	 others,	 their	 neediness	 was	 deeper	 than	 that.	 These	 women

desperately	craved	emotional	validation	as	well	as	sexual	validation.	They	would
launch	 into	 crying	 fits,	 call	 Roy	 dozens	 of	 times	 over	 the	 course	 of	 a	 night	 or
show	up	at	his	apartment	unannounced.	The	sex	was	often	incredible,	but	it	was
almost	 impossible	 for	 Roy’s	 own	 anger	 and	 insecurities	 to	 not	 get	 sucked	 into
the	drama	of	these	other	women.	Dramatic	episodes	would	go	on	for	weeks	or
sometimes	months	in	a	cycle	of	angry	breakup,	back	to	loving	reunion,	back	to
angry	 breakup,	 over	 and	 over	 again,	 each	 time	 getting	 more	 intense.	 Many	 of
these	women	had	experienced	sexual	abuse	in	their	past.	Eventually,	Roy	would
tire	 of	 their	 games	 and	 break	 things	 off	 permanently,	 swearing	 to	 never	 let
himself	succumb	to	them	again.	But	often	the	next	“crazy”	girl	would	be	right
around	the	corner.

I	always	tell	men,	if	every	girl	you	date	is	unstable	and	crazy,	that’s	a	reflection
of	your	emotional	maturity	level.	It’s	a	reflection	of	your	confidence	or	lack	of
confidence.	 It’s	 a	 reflection	 of	 your	 neediness.	 Non-needy	 people	 don’t	 date
needy	 people	 and	 vice-versa.	 They	 can’t	 because	 there’s	 no	 attraction	 to	 begin
with.

If	 all	 of	 the	 women	 you	 attract	 are	 needy	 and	 emotionally	 helpless,	 what	 does
that	say	about	you?

Roy	went	from	being	needy	to	overcompensating	with	narcissism.	He	went	from
worshipping	women	with	no	respect	for	himself	to	worshipping	himself	with	no
respect	 for	 women.	 The	 key	 to	 non-neediness	 is	 to	 have	 both:	 respect	 for	 both
oneself	and	for	women.

The	 only	 permanent	 way	 to	 attract	 and	 date	 more	 women	 and	 more	 attractive
women	is	to	become	more	attractive	yourself.	And	the	way	a	man	becomes	more
attractive	himself	is	by	investing	in	himself,	in	becoming	less	needy.

Permanent	change	to	one’s	investment	and	neediness	in	one’s	relationships	with
women	is	hard	and	is	a	process	that	encompasses	all	facets	of	one’s	life.	But	it’s
a	worthwhile	journey.	As	a	man,	it	may	be	the	most	worthwhile	journey.

And	 the	 key	 to	 it	 is	 probably	 something	 you	 wouldn’t	 expect.	 In	 fact,	 it’s
something	 that	 most	 men	 turn	 their	 nose	 up	 at	 when	 they	 hear	 it.	 The	 key	 is
vulnerability.

Chapter	2:
Power	in	Vulnerability

When	 most	 men	 hear	 the	 word	 “vulnerability,”	 their	 immediate	 reaction	 is	 to
associate	it	with	weakness.	In	general,	men	are	raised	to	withhold	their	emotions,
to	 not	 show	 weakness,	 and	 to	 ignore	 any	 hint	 of	 introspection.	 On	 top	 of	 that,
most	 of	 the	 popular	 dating	 advice	 out	 there	 encourages	 guys	 to	 be	 aloof,
standoffish,	judgmental,	and	at	times,	scathing	towards	women.

Men	have	a	lot	of	negative	assumptions	about	the	idea	of	being	more	vulnerable
and	opening	up	to	their	emotions.	Chances	are	it	makes	you	a	little	skeptical	or
queasy	to	even	see	me	writing	about	this.

Don’t	worry,	I’m	not	going	to	have	you	hold	hands	around	a	campfire	with	some
wimpy	support	group	and	cry	about	your	spirit	crystal	or	share	stories	about	your
power	animal.

I	 want	 you	 to	 think	 of	 vulnerability	 in	 a	 more	 broad	 way.	 Not	 just	 emotional
vulnerability	 (although	 we’ll	 get	 to	 that),	 but	 physical	 vulnerability,	 social
vulnerability.

For	 instance,	 making	 yourself	 vulnerable	 doesn’t	 just	 mean	 being	 willing	 to
share	your	fears	or	insecurities.	It	can	mean	putting	yourself	in	a	position	where
you	 can	 be	 rejected,	 saying	 a	 joke	 that	 may	 not	 be	 funny,	 asserting	 an	 opinion
that	 may	 offend	 others,	 introducing	 yourself	 to	 a	 group	 of	 people	 you	 don’t
know,	telling	a	woman	that	you	like	her	and	want	to	date	her.	All	of	these	things
require	you	to	stick	your	neck	out	on	the	line	emotionally	in	some	way.	You’re
making	yourself	vulnerable	when	you	do	them.

In	this	way,	vulnerability	represents	a	form	of	power,	a	deep	and	subtle	form	of
power.	 It’s	 courageous,	 even.	 A	 man	 who’s	 able	 to	 make	 himself	 vulnerable	 is
saying	to	the	world,	“Screw	the	repercussions;	this	is	who	I	am,	and	I	refuse	to
be	anyone	else.”	He’s	saying	he	is	non-needy	and	high	status.

Most	people	think	of	a	man	who’s	vulnerable	as	a	man	who	cowers	in	the	corner
and	begs	others	to	accept	him	or	not	hurt	him.	This	is	not	vulnerability;	this	is
surrender.	It’s	weakness.

Think	 of	 it	 this	 way,	 there	 are	 two	 men.	 One	 stands	 tall,	 looks	 straight	 ahead.
Looks	 people	 in	 the	 eye	 when	 he	 speaks	 to	 them.	 Says	 what	 he	 thinks	 and	 is
comfortable	 if	 some	 people	 disagree	 with	 him.	 When	 he	 makes	 a	 mistake,	 he
shrugs	it	off	and	apologizes	if	necessary.	When	he	sucks	at	something,	he	admits
it.	 He’s	 unafraid	 to	 express	 his	 emotions,	 even	 if	 that	 means	 he	 gets	 rejected
because	of	them	sometimes.	He	has	no	problem	moving	on	to	people	who	don’t
reject	him,	but	instead	like	him	for	who	he	is.

The	 second	 man	 hunches	 over,	 his	 eyes	 dart	 around	 and	 he	 is	 unable	 to	 look
someone	 in	 the	 eye	 without	 getting	 uncomfortable.	 He	 puts	 on	 a	 cool	 persona
that	is	always	aloof.	He	performs.	He	avoids	saying	things	that	may	upset	others,
and	sometimes	even	lies	to	avoid	conflict.	He’s	always	trying	to	impress	people.
When	 he	 makes	 a	 mistake,	 he	 tries	 to	 blame	 others	 or	 pretend	 like	 it	 didn’t
happen.	 He	 hides	 his	 emotions	 and	 will	 smile	 and	 tell	 everyone	 he’s	 fine	 even
when	 he’s	 not.	 He’s	 scared	 to	 death	 of	 rejection.	 And	 when	 he	 is	 rejected,	 it
sends	him	reeling,	angry,	and	desperate	to	find	a	way	to	win	back	the	affection	of
the	person	who	doesn’t	like	him.

Which	one	of	these	two	men	is	more	powerful?	Which	one	is	more	vulnerable?
Which	one	is	more	comfortable	with	himself?	Which	one	do	you	think	women
would	be	more	attracted	to?

From	 an	 evolutionary	 perspective,	 vulnerability	 makes	 perfect	 sense	 as	 an
indicator	to	women	of	male	status	and	fitness.	Let’s	say	there’s	a	tribe	of	20	men,
all	 hunter-gatherers,	 all	 men	 with	 more	 or	 less	 equal	 possessions	 (or	 lack
thereof).

Some	of	the	men	in	the	tribe	are	constantly	reactive	to	what	the	other	men	tell
them.	They	don’t	admit	faults.	They	change	their	behavior	and	what	they	say	to
win	the	approval	of	the	other	men.	When	something	doesn’t	go	their	way,	they
look	 to	 blame	 someone	 else.	 What	 would	 this	 say	 about	 their	 status	 in	 their
tribe?	If	they’re	basing	all	of	their	behavior	on	the	approval	of	the	other	men	and
are	constantly	covering	up	their	weaknesses,	it	says	that	they’re	low	status,	not
trustworthy,	unconfident,	and	probably	not	going	to	be	a	dependable	father.

Now	imagine	other	men	in	the	same	tribe	who	are	unfazed	by	the	neediness	or
temper	tantrums	of	the	other	men	around	them.	They	focus	purely	on	the	task	at
hand	and	don’t	change	their	behavior	based	on	what	others	think	of	them.	When
challenged,	 they	 stand	 up	 for	 themselves,	 but	 when	 they’re	 wrong,	 they	 also

admit	 their	 fault	 since	 they	 see	 no	 reason	 to	 hide	 their	 weakness.	 They	 have	 a
sense	of	honor.	They	don’t	react	to	any	of	the	other	men	around	them;	rather,	the
other	men	react	to	them.

This	behavior	implies	high	status,	a	man	who	is	dependable,	comfortable	in	his
strengths	and	weaknesses,	a	man	who	can	be	counted	on	and	who	is	likely	to	rise
through	the	ranks	and	provide	for	his	offspring.

He’s	likely	to	succeed	and	likely	to	be	a	dependable	father.

It’s	 likely	 that	 women	 have	 been	 naturally	 selected	 to	 choose	 high-status	 men
based	 on	 their	 non-neediness	 first,	 and	 then	 their	 looks	 and	 accomplishments
second,	 since	 looks	 and	 accomplishments	 tend	 to	 be	 reflections	 of	 non-needy
behavior,	 not	 the	 other	 way	 around.	 This	 non-needy	 behavior	 indicates	 a	 man
who	 is	 comfortable	 with	 vulnerability,	 who	 isn’t	 afraid	 to	 express	 who	 he	 is,
warts	 and	 all,	 to	 the	 world.	 This	 plays	 out	 in	 multiple	 arenas	 —	 in	 the	 life
decisions	he	makes	(Part	III),	the	extent	of	his	courage	(Part	IV)	and	the	way	he
communicates	to	others	(Part	V).

Chances	 are,	 if	 you’re	 reading	 this	 and	 are	 bad	 with	 women,	 then	 you’re	 bad
with	 women	 because	 you	 don’t	 express	 your	 true	 feelings	 and	 intentions	 very
well.	Perhaps	you’re	afraid	to	introduce	yourself	to	women	you	find	attractive	or
to	ask	them	out	on	a	date.	Perhaps	you	consistently	fall	into	boring	conversation
topics	because	they’re	“safe”	and	shallow	and	you	don’t	have	to	risk	offending
or	inciting	anyone	with	them.	Perhaps	you	don’t	assert	yourself	and	your	desires
enough.	 Perhaps	 you	 hide	 from	 your	 own	 sexuality	 and	 become	 scared	 or
nervous	when	people	expose	theirs.	Perhaps	you’re	stuck	in	a	job	or	lifestyle	you
don’t	truly	enjoy	because	other	people	always	told	you	that	it	was	a	good	idea
and	 you	 didn’t	 want	 to	 upset	 or	 disappoint	 the	 people	 around	 you.	 Dressing
extremely	 well	 makes	 you	 feel	 uncomfortable,	 smiling	 at	 strangers	 makes	 you
feel	creepy,	and	the	idea	of	hitting	on	a	woman	openly	scares	you	because	of	the
possibility	of	rejection.

All	of	these	are	symptoms	of	a	root	problem:	an	inability	to	be	vulnerable.

Many	men,	like	you,	and	like	me,	were	raised	in	such	a	way	as	to	not	express	our
emotions	 freely.	 For	 whatever	 reason	 —	 maybe	 our	 home	 situation,	 maybe
childhood	 trauma,	 maybe	 our	 parents	 didn’t	 express	 their	 emotions	 either	 —
we’ve	 grown	 up	 with	 deeply	 embedded	 habits	 designed	 to	 keep	 us	 stifled	 and

bottled	up.	Don’t	be	controversial.	Don’t	be	unique.	Don’t	do	anything	“crazy”
or	“stupid”	or	“selfish.”

I	was	the	same	way.	For	my	entire	young	life,	I	was	terrified	of	anyone	not	liking
me.	 The	 mere	 thought	 of	 someone	 hating	 me,	 girl	 or	 guy,	 would	 literally	 keep
me	 up	 at	 night.	 As	 a	 result,	 every	 aspect	 of	 my	 life	 revolved	 around	 people-
pleasing,	 hiding	 my	 faults,	 covering	 my	 tracks,	 and	 blaming	 others.	 And
needless	to	say,	I	barely	had	any	success	with	women.	And	when	I	did	finally	get
a	girlfriend,	she	left	my	ass	for	a	man	who	could	actually	express	himself.

This	 all	 may	 sound	 hokey	 and	 new-agey.	 Trust	 me,	 it’s	 not.	 Connecting	 with
women	 in	 this	 way,	 by	 being	 vulnerable	 —	 as	 opposed	 to	 performance	 or
narcissism	 —	 will	 result	 in	 some	 of	 the	 best	 interactions	 and	 relationships	 of
your	life.

Vulnerability	 is	 the	 path	 of	 true	 human	 connection	 and	 becoming	 a	 truly
attractive	 person.	 As	 psychologist	 Robert	 Glover	 once	 said,	 “Humans	 are
attracted	to	each	other’s	rough	edges.”

Show	 your	 rough	 edges.	 Stop	 trying	 to	 be	 perfect.	 Expose	 yourself	 and	 share
yourself	without	inhibition.	Take	the	rejections	and	lumps	and	move	on	because
you’re	a	bigger	and	stronger	man.	And	when	you	find	a	woman	who	loves	who
you	are	(and	you	will),	revel	in	her	affection.

But	 opening	 yourself	 up	 to	 vulnerability,	 training	 yourself	 to	 become
comfortable	with	your	emotions,	with	your	faults,	and	with	expressing	yourself
without	inhibitions	doesn’t	happen	overnight.	This	entire	book	can	be	viewed	as
a	how-to	guide	for	vulnerability.	But	it’s	a	process,	and	at	times,	a	grueling	one.

The	Pain	Period

When	undertaking	any	emotional	shift	or	change	in	behavior,	there’s	going	to	be
an	 initial	 “pain	 period.”	 The	 pain	 period	 typically	 happens	 in	 the	 beginning	 of
the	 change	 and	 forming	 a	 new	 habit.	 It’s	 the	 period	 of	 greatest	 resistance	 and
discomfort	and	the	period	in	which	most	people	give	up.

Whether	it’s	bodybuilding,	learning	a	new	language	or	starting	a	new	job,	there’s
going	to	be	an	awkward	and	difficult	period	where	you’re	going	to	struggle,	fail
at	times,	and	most	of	all,	feel	vulnerable.

Most	people	absolutely	hate	this	feeling	and	avoid	it	as	much	as	possible.	Being
vulnerable	 hurts.	 It’s	 embarrassing.	 It’s	 difficult.	 And	 as	 a	 result,	 these	 people
don’t	learn	new	things	or	improve	the	old	ones.	That	first	time	you	approach	a
woman	at	a	party	or	offer	your	number,	chances	are	you’re	going	to	be	freaking
out.	And	if	she	 doesn’t	react	 well,	 it’s	going	 to	be	quite	painful.	And	 that’s	all
right.	That	first	time	you	pick	up	the	phone	to	call	a	girl	you	like.	The	first	time
you	 go	 in	 for	 the	 kiss.	 These	 are	 nerve-wracking	 moments	 that	 are	 not	 very
pleasant	to	go	through.

It’s	 especially	 difficult	 if	 you’ve	 already	 had	 success	 in	 the	 past	 through
performance	 or	 narcissism.	 Practicing	 vulnerability	 often	 means	 that	 you	 will
have	to	“get	worse	before	you	get	better.”

And	chances	are,	the	more	you’ve	bottled	up	your	emotions	throughout	your	life,
the	more	painful	these	actions	are	going	to	be.	As	vulnerability	researcher	Brene
Brown	says,	“The	less	you	talk	about	your	shame,	the	more	of	it	you	have.”

This	 book	 presents	 myriad	 ways	 in	 which	 to	 become	 more	 vulnerable:	 how	 to
express	 yourself	 better	 through	 dress,	 through	 conversation,	 through	 humor,
through	your	sexuality.

And	I	can	tell	you	right	now,	you’re	going	to	feel	uncomfortable.	You’re	going
to	come	up	with	rationalizations	about	how	you	don’t	really	have	to	do	that,	do
you?	 How	 I	 don’t	 know	 what	 I’m	 talking	 about.	 How	 you’re	 too	 busy	 or	 you
will	 get	 to	 it	 later.	 You’ll	 plan	 ahead,	 procrastinate	 and	 then	 re-plan	 and	 then
procrastinate	 again,	 and	 then	 decide	 you	 need	 to	 read	 this	 book	 a	 couple	 more
times	—	all	because	you’re	scared	to	death	of	simply	being	vulnerable.

Maybe	you’ve	already	been	through	this.	Maybe	you’ve	already	spent	months	or
years	avoiding	taking	action	because	you’re	afraid	of	the	consequences.	Maybe
you’ve	put	off	that	career	change,	that	wardrobe	upgrade,	joining	that	dating	site.
Maybe	 you’ve	 missed	 opportunities	 with	 women	 who	 liked	 you	 because	 you
were	too	afraid	to	make	a	move.	Maybe	you	convinced	yourself	that	you	needed
to	 “know	 how”	 first.	 Maybe	 you	 convinced	 yourself	 that	 you	 needed	 to	 see
someone	else	do	it	first.

These	 are	 all	 forms	 of	 avoidance.	 And	 they	 all	 come	 from	 a	 deep-seated
neediness,	and	that	neediness	can	only	be	cured	through	making	yourself	more
vulnerable.	And	at	first,	that	vulnerability	is	going	to	hurt.

You	can’t	skip	it.	The	only	way	out	of	it	is	through	it.

I’ll	give	you	two	examples	from	my	own	pain	period	when	I	was	first	learning	to
open	 myself	 up	 and	 become	 vulnerable.	 Two	 girls,	 let’s	 call	 them	 Melina	 and
Kate.	Melina	may	have	been	the	first	girl	I	dated	after	my	disastrous	break	up	in
2005.	 She	 and	 I	 had	 great	 natural	 chemistry	 and	 would	 sit	 around	 and	 talk	 for
hours.	 But	 little	 did	 I	 realize	 how	 angry	 I	 was	 and	 how	 much	 baggage	 I	 was
carrying	around	from	my	ex.

So	one	night,	talking	with	Melina,	I	just	went	off	—	for	like	15	minutes	straight,
about	my	stupid	whore	of	an	ex,	and	went	into	minute	detail	about	all	the	fucked
up	 stuff	 she	 did,	 just	 on	 and	 on	 and	 on	 and	 on.	 So	 bitter	 and	 hurt.	 So
unnecessary.

I	finished.	I	hadn’t	even	realized	how	long	I	had	gone	on	rambling.	Then	after	an
awkward	 silence,	 Melina	 looked	 at	 me	 as	 if	 scared	 by	 something	 and	 calmly
said,	“I	probably	didn’t	need	to	know	all	of	that.”

Ouch.

She	and	I	quickly	fell	apart	and	stopped	seeing	each	other.	I	was	mortified.	I	ran
into	 her	 a	 number	 of	 times	 after	 that	 for	 months	 and	 I	 would	 always	 feel
nauseous	with	embarrassment.

But	as	awful	as	this	experience	was,	it	was	important.	It	was	the	first	time	I	had
opened	 up	 about	 my	 feelings	 about	 my	 relationship.	 And	 I	 noticed	 that	 in	 the
future	 I	 became	 much	 more	 comfortable	 talking	 about	 it.	 And	 once	 I	 was
comfortable	talking	about	it,	I	began	to	 notice	 things	 I	 had	done	wrong	 in	that
relationship,	ways	that	I	could	be	a	better	man	and	a	better	partner.	But	for	me	to
get	there,	I	had	to	be	willing	to	take	that	first	awkward,	vulnerable	step.

Then	there	was	Kate.	Kate	was	slightly	older	than	me	and	extremely	sexual.	Our
“first	date”	was	her	calling	me	on	the	phone	and	flat	out	saying,	“I	want	you	to
come	to	my	apartment	and	fuck	me	on	my	kitchen	counter.”

“Uhh…	OK,	sounds	good.”	I	played	it	cool.	I	was	terrified	in	my	head,	though.
Girls	really	do	this	stuff?	What	does	this	mean?	She	barely	even	knows	me.

So	I	get	over	there.	I’m	freaking	out,	all	up	in	my	head,	and	I	can’t	even	keep	it
up	 long	 enough	 to	 get	 it	 in	 her.	 Once	 again,	 completely	 mortified.	 This	 had

happened	 with	 other	 girls	 before,	 but	 I	 had	 always	 been	 drunk	 so	 I	 had	 an
excuse.	It	was	the	alcohol,	not	my	own	twisted,	fucked	up	head.

But	 no	 excuse	 this	 time.	 As	 Kate	 sat	 there	 naked	 on	 her	 kitchen	 counter,	 both
expectant	and	horribly	disappointed,	I	became	cornered.	I	had	to	own	up	to	my
own	fears.	I	wasn’t	such	a	badass	playboy,	nor	some	smooth	motherfucker.	No,	I
was	a	nervous	dude	with	a	lot	of	sexual	insecurities	and	emotional	baggage.	So	I
owned	up	to	it.	I	told	her	that	I	was	inexperienced	and	was	just	coming	out	of	a
major	dry	spell	and	that	I	was	really	nervous.	I	could	see	her	attraction	for	me
spiral	away.

Fortunately,	 Kate	 was	 much	 cooler	 with	 my	 insecurities	 than	 Melina	 was.	 She
said	she	understood,	to	relax,	take	my	time,	let	her	know	or	whatever.	And	then	I
did	 the	 super,	 lame	 beta	 thing	 that	 every	 pick	 up	 book	 told	 me	 to	 never,	 ever,
ever	do:	I	asked	her	if	we	could	get	to	know	each	other	better	first.

Again,	it	went	against	everything	a	“real	man”	was	supposed	to	do.	But	it	was
vulnerable	and	it	was	true.

And	 we	 did.	 And	 then	 we	 had	 sex	 later,	 once	 I	 had	 calmed	 down	 and	 was
comfortable.	She	was	supportive	and	didn’t	hold	it	against	me.	And	we	went	on
to	date	for	months	and	have	wild	and	crazy	sex	on	all	sorts	of	furniture	around
the	house.	It	was	amazing.	I	just	needed	that	time	to	open	up	and	relax.	I	dated
her	on	and	off	for	almost	a	year.	The	sex	was	great.	And	she	was	a	great	friend.

Obviously,	your	issues	and	neediness	are	going	to	be	different.	My	point	in	all	of
this,	though,	is	that	early	on,	when	the	neediness	and	vulnerability	come	out,	it's
awful.	 It’s	 not	 sexy.	 In	 fact,
incredibly	 unattractive	 and
uncomfortable.

it’s	 usually

But	that’s	part	of	the	process.	The	Pain	Period.	Slowly,	you	become	comfortable
with	 it.	 You	 become	 unattached	 to	 it.	 And	 then	 you	 become	 OK	 with	 it.	 The
things	I	just	wrote	above	embarrassed	me	to	the	point	that	I	wanted	to	die	when
they	happened.	Now	I	can	talk	about	them	without	shame	or	regret.	And	these
are	the	types	of	stories	that	I’ll	often	share	with	new	women	when	I	date	them,
told	in	a	similar	fashion.

“I	was	embarrassed.	Yes,	it	sucked.	Yes,	I	have	issues.	No,	I’m	not	perfect.”	The
implication	 being	 the	 whole	 time	 that	 I’m	 fine	 with	 it.	 I’m	 not	 looking	 for
sympathy	or	validation.	I	don’t	need	anything	from	her.	It’s	just	who	I	am,	rough

edges	and	all.

We	 all	 have	 weaknesses,	 embarrassments,	 and	 vulnerabilities.	 A	 needy	 man	 is
terrified	to	show	them	because	he	cares	more	about	what	others	feel	about	him
than	what	he	feels	about	himself.	A	non-needy	man	is	comfortable	showing	his
flaws	because	he’s	more	comfortable	with	how	he	feels	about	himself	than	how
others	feel	about	him.

Sharing	yourself	openly	with	others	forces	that	transition	between	the	two:	from
needy	and	afraid	of	what	others	think,	to	non-needy	and	comfortable	in	how	you
feel	 about	 yourself.	 The	 reason	 is	 because	 sharing	 these	 truths	 about	 yourself
forces	 you	 to	 own	 them	 and	 accept	 them,	 and	 also	 demonstrates	 that	 feeling
embarrassed	 or	 ashamed	 is	 just	 that,	 just	 another	 feeling,	 another	 part	 of	 your
humanity,	not	the	end	of	the	world.

The	real	question	is,	do	you	have	 to	work	through	 this	emotional	baggage	and
neediness	with	the	women	you’re	dating?	Not	necessarily.	You	can	work	through
them	by	sharing	them	with	friends,	family	members,	or	a	therapist.	But	there	are
some	 issues	 that	 can	 only	 be	 dealt	 with	 by	 women	 you’re	 seeing:	 particularly
intimacy	and	sexual	issues.

But	 slowly,	 you	 will	 chisel	 away	 at	 yourself.	 You’ll	 humble	 yourself,	 expose
yourself,	 and	 then	 learn	 that	 it’s	 OK.	 It’s	 OK	 to	 be	 rejected.	 It’s	 OK	 to	 make
mistakes.	 It’s	 OK	 to	 say	 something	 stupid.	 Don’t	 give	 up.	 Women	 will	 not
dislike	you	for	your	rejections	and	mistakes	or	saying	something	stupid.

They’ll	like	you	for	your	ability	to	be	OK	with	being	rejected,	to	make	mistakes,
and	to	say	something	stupid.	The	man	who	always	has	the	perfect	line	to	say	to
her	is	a	man	she	will	not	trust	because	he	shows	no	vulnerability	and	his	words
are	inauthentic	and,	therefore,	needy.

The	man	who	has	some	good	lines	and	some	bad	lines	and	is	able	to	admit	the
latter	and	laugh	at	the	former,	this	is	a	man	she	will	trust	and	a	man	she	will	open
herself	up	to,	both	emotionally	and	physically.	Become	comfortable	with	being
imperfect.	It’s	your	rough	edges	she’ll	be	attracted	to.

This	isn’t	pretty	at	first.	The	worst	part	of	the	pain	period	is	the	fact	that	most
people	who	have	been	stifling	their	emotions	their	entire	lives	have	a	lot	of	pent-
up	anger,	frustration,	and	shame.	Typically,	the	older	you	are,	the	more	you	have
pent	up.	And	when	you	start	to	express	this	anger	and	shame,	the	uglier	it	gets.

You	 may	 find	 yourself	 behaving	 irrationally,	 developing	 strange	 beliefs,	 or
becoming	angry	with	many	people.	In	many	cases,	this	is	why	I	encourage	men
who	struggle	deeply	with	vulnerability	to	see	a	therapist	who	can	perhaps	guide
them	through	this	process.

You	may	be	reading	this	and	thinking,	“Well,	that’s	all	fine,	but	I	already	express
myself	really	well	and	am	pretty	aware	of	my	emotions.”

Really?

See,	 I	 don’t	 buy	 it.	 In	 all	 of	 my	 years	 doing	 this,	 the	 single	 common	 thread
between	every	man	I’ve	worked	with	who	has	problems	with	women	is	either	a
lack	of	awareness	of	his	own	emotional	motivators	or	an	inability	to	express	his
emotions	freely	with	those	around	him.	And	the	sad	part	is,	almost	all	of	these
men	 think	 they’re	 fine.	 We	 always	 think	 that	 we’re	 the	 ones	 who	 are	 fine.	 It’s
everyone	else	who	is	screwed	up.

But	I’ll	say	this:	if	you	consistently	find	it	difficult	to	keep	a	woman	interested	in
conversation;	if	you	suffer	from	large	amounts	of	anxiety	around	women;	if	you
constantly	 feel	 a	 need	 to	 prove	 something	 to	 others	 or	 yourself,	 then	 there’s
something	 there.	 Trust	 me,	 there’s	 something	 there.	 And	 there’s	 something
you’re	not	expressing	or	some	emotion	you’re	not	in	touch	with.	And	that’s	fine.
We	all	go	through	it.

Ultimately,	 what	 women	 want	 —	 what	 we	 all	 really	 want	 —	 is	 a	 strong,
independent,	non-needy	partner	who	fulfills	us,	who	we	can	share	ourselves	with
and	receive	them	in	return.

Because	sharing	yourself	with	someone	doesn’t	mean	just	physically	occupying
the	 same	 area.	 It	 doesn’t	 mean	 exchanging	 facts	 with	 one	 another.	 It	 means
opening	up	about	your	values,	desires,	feelings,	and	dreams.	It	means	exposing
your	 shame	 and	 insecurities	 and	 doubts	 and	 fears.	 It	 means	 living	 with
somebody	 on	 an	 emotional	 plane,	 inhabiting	 that	 same	 heart-space	 together
because	that’s	the	one	thing	we	can’t	ever	achieve	by	ourselves.

But	there’s	a	catch.	Many	men,	when	they	finish	this	chapter	or	hear	this	whole
vulnerability	 spiel,	 their	 first	 reaction	 is	 to	 say,	 “Oh,	 OK,	 so	 I’ll	 tell	 her	 all	 of
these	sob	stories	and	she’ll	want	to	have	sex.	Got	it.”

No.	Wrong.	It’s	not	about	words	or	behaviors,	it’s	about	intentions.	So	if	you’re

going	around	telling	sob	stories	and	talking	about	insecurities	to	get	laid,	women
will	sense	that	and	you	will	be	a	creep.	That	is	not	vulnerability;	that	is	merely
another	form	of	performance.	And	all	performance	is	neediness.

Similarly,	if	you	go	around	saying	and	doing	whatever	you	want	around	women
in	 the	 name	 of	 “expressing	 yourself,”	 this,	 too,	 will	 not	 “work”	 because	 your
intention	is	not	to	connect	with	her	and	get	to	know	her,	but	rather	simple	self-
gratification.	 This	 is	 not	 vulnerability,	 this	 is	 narcissism.	 And	 all	 narcissism
comes	from	neediness.

Stop	 looking	 at	 communication	 as	 the	 surface	 information	 and	 instead,	 pay
attention	to	the	emotions	and	motivations	behind	everything	that	you	do	and	say.
That's	where	all	of	the	meaning	is.

I’ll	say	this	again	because	this	often	gets	lost:	vulnerability	is	not	a	technique	or
tactic.	 It	 is	 a	 way	 of	 being.	 It’s	 not	 something	 you	 learn,	 it’s	 a	 mindset	 you
practice.

Sometimes	I	get	emails	from	men	saying	something	like,	“Hey,	I	told	this	girl	all
about	 my	 dog	 dying	 and	 how	 I	 hate	 my	 mom.	 She	 didn’t	 have	 sex	 with	 me.
Vulnerability	doesn’t	work.”

And	 when	 I	 get	 these	 emails,	 I	 shake	 my	 head.	 He	 doesn’t	 get	 it.	 “Doesn’t
work,”	he	says.

Here’s	a	piece	of	advice:	if	you	ever	find	yourself	thinking,	“That	didn’t	work,”
or	“This	doesn’t	work,”	then	you	are	performing	and	you	are	needy.	Point	blank.
Period.

The	whole	idea	of	something	“working”	on	women,	is	itself	a	form	of	neediness.
Because	a	sexual	connection	is	not	something	you	achieve.	It’s	not	a	level	in	a
video	game	that	you	beat.	It’s	not	something	you	can	strategize.	It’s	either	there
or	it’s	not.

When	 women	 emotionally	 connect	 with	 you	 and	 your	 desire	 for	 them,	 it’s	 not
what	you’re	saying	or	the	words	you’re	choosing,	it’s	the	emotion	behind	those
words.	If	the	emotion	behind	your	words	is	needy	and	self-serving,	then	she	will
become	 turned	 off	 no	 matter	 what	 you	 say,	 even	 if	 you’re	 telling	 her	 the	 most
personal	 or	 heartfelt	 story.	 If	 the	 emotion	 behind	 your	 words	 is	 genuine	 and
vulnerable,	then	it	will	turn	her	on,	even	if	you’re	talking	about	your	grocery	list

or	how	you	named	your	dog.	Yes,	you	can	fake	this	stuff	in	the	short-term	if	you
become	 a	good	actor.	But	obviously,	don’t	do	that.	We’re	not	in	this	for	short-
term	fixes,	remember?

So	the	catch	is	that	your	statements	must	be	authentic.	Your	statements	towards
women	must	be	unconditional,	otherwise	it’s	not	really	being	vulnerable.	If	you
tell	a	woman	that	she’s	beautiful	only	because	you	think	it’ll	give	you	a	better
chance	of	sleeping	with	her,	then	amazingly,	she	will	not	be	very	flattered.	Try	it.
It’s	true.	Give	women	false	compliments	and	see	how	they	respond.	They	won’t
respond	very	well.

But	communicate	with	honest	appreciation	and	you’ll	be	amazed	how	she	lights
up	in	front	of	you.

So	the	catch	is	that	everything	you	say	must	be	as	authentic	as	possible.	There’s
no	 shortcut.	 There	 are	 no	 tricks.	 You	 say	 it	 because	 you	 mean	 it	 and	 mean	 it
because	you	say	it.	The	more	nervous	it	makes	you,	the	better,	because	it	means
you’re	being	authentic	and	making	yourself	vulnerable.

How	attractive	you	are	is	based	on	your	lack	of	neediness.	Your	non-neediness	is
based	 on	 how	 vulnerable	 you’re	 able	 to	 make	 yourself.	 And	 how	 vulnerable
you’re	 able	 to	 make	 yourself	 is	 based	 on	 how	 honest	 you	 are	 to	 yourself	 and
others.

Which	brings	us	to	our	next	chapter:	the	gift	of	truth.

Chapter	3:
The	Gift	of	Truth

“Hey	honey,	can	I	pee	in	your	butt?”

I	stood	there	horrified	as	my	friend	shouted	this	at	literally	every	attractive	girl
who	came	within	five	feet	of	us.

The	year	was	2006.	I	was	in	college,	and	at	the	time,	to	help	myself	get	better
with	girls,	I	started	hanging	out	with	a	couple	guys	who	got	more	women	than
anyone	else	I	knew.	I	was	young	and	naïve	and	needy	and	still	saw	relationships
in	 terms	 of	 performance.	 The	 idea,	 then,	 was	 that	 I’d	 go	 out	 with	 these	 super
player	guys,	study	what	they	said	to	women	and	then	emulate	it	to	be	successful
myself.

Enter	my	friend	Matt	and	“Can	I	pee	in	your	butt?”

Matt	was	a	guy	I	briefly	met	once	through	a	friend,	but	his	reputation	was	widely
known.	He	was	in	a	rock	band,	had	tattoos	down	his	arms,	and	banged	girls	like
it	was	his	part-time	job.	I	had	run	into	him	by	chance	a	week	or	two	earlier	and
this	was	my	first	time	hanging	out	with	him	for	a	whole	night.

As	 you	 can	 imagine,	 his	 “Can	 I	 pee	 in	 your	 butt?”	 comment	 wasn’t	 entirely
successful.	In	fact,	I	think	just	about	every	girl	ran	away	from	us	in	horror.	Matt
was	 drunk	 and	 I	 was	 seriously	 questioning	 what	 the	 hell	 I	 was	 doing	 out	 with
him.

But	then	something	funny	happened.	A	couple	girls	laughed.	And	then	suddenly
another	girl	actually	hung	around	and	kept	talking	to	us.

Needless	 to	 say,	 back	 in	 2006,	 there	 hadn’t	 been	 anything	 written	 in	 pick	 up
manuals	that	I	had	studied	about	how	to	transition	out	of	a	“Can	I	pee	in	your
butt?”	opener.	So	I	stood	there	awkward	and	confused,	waiting	to	see	how	this
would	turn	out.

Next	thing	I	know	Matt	is	telling	her	he’s	going	to	lick	her	butthole	tonight…

OK,	forget	this,	I’m	going	home.	I	don’t	want	to	be	associated	with	this	clown

when	he	gets	us	thrown	out	of	the	bar,	or	worse,	arrested	for	sexual	harassment.

About	 fifteen	 minutes	 later,	 Matt	 finds	 me,	 and	 surprisingly	 he’s	 got	 his	 arm
around	the	girl	he	had	been	talking	to.	She’s	got	a	huge	smile	across	her	face.

“Hey	man,	we’re	heading	back	to	her	place,	it	was	great	hanging	out,	we	should
do	it	again	sometime.”

I	sat	there	in	the	bar	alone,	trying	to	piece	together	what	I	had	just	seen.	It	made
no	sense	and	went	against	everything	I	had	ever	known	about	women	my	entire
life.

To	 this	 day,	 this	 was	 one	 of	 the	 most	 pivotal	 nights	 for	 me	 as	 far	 as
understanding	 attraction	 is	 concerned.	 Was	 it	 that	 I	 learned	 that	 “Can	 I	 pee	 in
your	butt?”	is	the	right	thing	to	say?

No,	 actually,	 I	 still	 think	 it’s	 a	 pretty	 awful	 thing	 to	 say.	 And	 truth	 be	 told,	 in
hindsight	my	friend	Matt	had	a	lot	of	narcissism	going	on.

But	what	I	learned	is	that	regardless	of	what	you	say	to	a	woman,	the	intention
and	implications	of	why	you	are	saying	it	are	far	more	powerful	than	the	words
themselves.

You	can	say	the	lamest	and	grossest	(or	funniest,	depending	on	your	perspective)
thing	 to	 women,	 and	 if	 the	 sub-communication	 is,	 “I	 really	 don’t	 care	 if	 you
laugh	or	run	away	horrified,	but	here’s	who	I	am,	take	it	or	leave	it,”	this	sub-
communicates	a	rock-bottom	level	of	investment	and	an	incredibly	high	level	of
vulnerability.

Does	this	mean	that	saying	grotesque	things	to	women	for	no	other	reason	than
to	self-amuse	will	get	you	laid?	Not	always.	And	not	necessarily	often.	But	you
could	do	worse.

Does	it	mean	that	you	should	go	out	and	try	and	say	things	like	this?	To	“fake	it
‘til	you	make	it”	with	this	line	and	other	offensive	lines?	Well,	actually,	no.	Do
you	know	why?

Most	men	can	relate	to	the	idea	of	trying	to	“pick	up”	a	woman	without	looking
like	they’re	trying.	Or	trying	to	be	cool	without	looking	like	they’re	trying	to	be
cool.	Entire	books	and	schools	of	dating	advice	have	been	built	on	this	idea	—

pursuing	a	woman	without	actually	letting	her	know	that	you’re	interested	in	her.

Just	typing	that	paragraph	feels	exhausting.	Talk	about	a	lot	of	work	for	nothing.

Like	I	described	before,	this	performance-based	stuff	works	sometimes,	but	it’s	a
short-term	 solution	 that	 requires	 a	 lot	 of	 time	 and	 effort.	 In	 my	 opinion,	 it’s	 a
terrible	investment	of	time	and	effort.	You	may	as	well	invest	that	time	and	effort
in	yourself	and	let	your	identity	and	honesty	do	all	of	the	attracting	for	you.

After	all,	why	learn	how	to	fake	being	cool,	when	you	can	just	learn	to	become
cool	yourself?

On	top	of	that,	walking	the	tightrope	of	pursuing	her	without	looking	like	you’re
pursuing	her	requires	a	lot	of	attention	and	effort.	You	can	slip	up	easily.	It’s	very
unforgiving	 and	 ultimately,	 not	 a	 very	 enjoyable	 process.	 Besides,	 all	 of	 the
attention	and	effort	on	“gaming”	women	this	way	ironically	encourages	you	to
be	 even	 more	 highly-invested	 and	 needy,	 therefore	 decreasing	 her	 likely
attraction	for	you.

Men	avoid	demonstrating	an	honest	interest	in	a	woman	because	they	believe	it
will	 signify	 that	 they	 are	 too	 invested	 in	 her	 —	 i.e.,	 it	 will	 show	 that	 they	 are
needy.	They	think	that	when	you	say,	“You’re	cute	and	I	wanted	to	meet	you,”
that	translates	roughly	to,	“Hi,	I’m	such	a	desperate	loser	that	I’m	just	going	to
throw	all	of	my	desires	out	there	right	now	and	beg	you	to	accept	them.”

But	 remember,	 it’s	 not	 the	 actual	 behaviors	 or	 words	 themselves,	 it’s	 the
intentions	behind	those	words.	There’s	a	world	of	sub-communication	going	on
behind	a	man’s	honest	declaration	of	his	interest.	And	it’s	an	attractive	one.

Because	when	a	man	comes	right	out	and	says	he’s	interested	in	a	woman,	the
sub-communication	 is	 actually,	 “I’m	 totally	 OK	 with	 the	 idea	 of	 you	 rejecting
me,	 otherwise	 I	 would	 not	 be	 approaching	 you	 in	 this	 manner.	 Therefore,	 I'm
comfortable	with	myself	and	my	prospects.”

Think	 about	 it,	 if	 a	 guy	 wasn’t	 comfortable	 with	 the	 prospect	 of	 a	 woman
rejecting	him,	he	wouldn’t	have	been	honest	in	the	first	place.	In	fact,	he	would
have	pretended	that	he	wasn’t	actually	interested	in	her!

The	fact	that	he	honestly	expressed	to	her	his	intentions,	that	he	put	his	nuts	on
the	 chopping	 block	 and	 made	 himself	 vulnerable	 to	 her	 immediately,	 actually

sub-communicates	non-neediness	and	attractiveness	in	itself.	And	on	top	of	that,
it	shows	desire	for	her,	which	is	going	to	trigger	her	arousal.

Remember:	what	you	actually	say	doesn’t	matter;	why	you	say	it	matters.

Always.	 No	 exceptions.	 You	 can	 have	 the	 best	 line	 in	 the	 world,	 but	 if	 you’re
saying	 it	 because	 you’re	 needy	 and	 desperate	 for	 validation	 and	 approval	 from
women,	then	she	is	immediately	going	to	sense	it.

This	is	why	using	pick	up	lines	is	ultimately	a	futile	process.	I	could	sell	you	the
best	100	things	I’ve	ever	said	to	women,	but	I	can’t	ever	sell	you	my	intentions
or	my	confidence	in	myself.	You	must	develop	those	on	your	own.	And	once	you
do,	the	actual	lines	you	say	will	be	 personal	and	congruent	to	you	 and	nobody
else.

The	Truth	Is	Always	Shining	Through

I’ll	go	ahead	and	tell	you	that	I	actually	did	go	out	and	say	“Can	I	pee	in	your
butt?”	to	women	the	next	week.	Can	you	guess	what	happened?

Nothing.

In	fact,	I	got	a	bunch	of	weird	and	disgusted	looks	and	not	a	single	laugh.

It’s	 because	 I	 was	 saying	 it	 looking	 for	 a	 reaction.	 Once	 again,	 I	 was	 highly
invested	in	how	women	responded	to	me.	I	simply	did	not	get	it	at	the	time.	It
didn’t	matter	what	I	said	or	didn’t	say;	if	I	said	it	in	a	way	that	demonstrated	I
cared	 way	 too	 much	 about	 how	 they	 responded	 to	 me,	 it	 would	 never	 work.	 I
would	come	off	as	a	creep	and	women	would	avoid	me	as	if	I	had	gonorrhea	on
my	face.

This	is	because	the	truth	is	always	shining	through.	You	can’t	fake	vulnerability
and	you	can’t	fake	honesty.	By	their	very	definition,	it’s	impossible.

Men’s	 dating	 advice	 gives	 women	 very	 little	 credit	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 this.
Women	 are	 generally	 quite	 intuitive	 to	 emotions,	 motivations,	 and	 social	 cues.
We	 may	 think	 we’re	 clever	 when	 we	 come	 up	 with	 a	 cute	 line	 to	 approach	 a
woman	with,	thinking	that	she	has	absolutely	no	idea	that	we’re	secretly	hitting
on	her.	She	does.	They	always	do.	And	it’s	not	a	big	deal	either.

And	 not	 only	 does	 she	 know	 we’re	 hitting	 on	 her,	 the	 fact	 that	 we	 seemed	 so
concerned	about	getting	rejected	turns	her	off.	The	fact	that	we	had	to	contrive
lines	 and	 fake	 stories	 in	 order	 to	 start	 a	 conversation	 with	 her,	 whether
consciously	 or	 not,	 signals	 to	 her	 that	 we	 are	 highly	 invested	 and	 not	 a	 truly
attractive	man.

You	cannot	fake	non-neediness	for	more	than	a	moment.	The	only	women	you
will	 manage	 to	 fake	 are	 women	 who	 are	 drunk	 or	 who	 are	 extremely	 needy
themselves.	Truth.

Non-needy	and	truly	high-quality	women	who	are	not	invested	in	the	attention
they	 receive	from	 men	 are	not	going	 to	have	much	patience	for	your	lines	and
games.	They	will	either	see	through	them	and	see	you	for	who	you	really	are	—
scared	 to	 expose	 your	 vulnerability	 —	 or	 they	 will	 simply	 assume	 you’re	 not
worth	 investing	 in	 because	 you’d	 rather	 just	 talk	 about	 spells	 or	 games	 or
whatever.

Vulnerability	 requires	 honesty,	 and	 honesty	 only	 works
it’s	 given
unconditionally,	with	no	strings	attached.	That	means	everything	you	say	and	do
must	 be	 done	 without	 any	 ulterior	 motive.	 You	 are	 simply	 expressing	 your
thoughts	and	feelings	as	they	come	to	you,	without	inhibition,	without	shame.

if

The	 truth	 is	 always	 shining	 through.	 Even	 if	 you	 lie	 about	 yourself	 or	 act	 a
certain	way,	this	is	actually	saying	much	more	about	you	and	your	character	than
the	content	of	your	statements.	Even	if	you	are	exaggerating	or	putting	on	a	bit
of	 an	 act	 to	 impress	 a	 person,	 your	 intentions	 will	 always	 shine	 through,
eventually,	and	they	will	say	more	about	you	than	any	word	ever	could.

You	can	tell	women	that	you’re	a	record	producer	and	are	friends	with	Jay-Z,	but
chances	are	unless	you’re	a	really	good	actor,	people	are	going	to	sense	subtle
inconsistencies	in	your	behavior	to	back	that	up.	Sooner	or	later,	they	will.	Then
your	 true	 identity	 will	 shine	 through,	 your	 lack	 of	 vulnerability	 with	 shine
through,	your	desperation	for	affection	will	shine	through,	and	you	will	be	a	sad,
pathetic	and	unattractive	man.

This	 is	 an	 extreme	 example,	 but	 it	 plays	 itself	 out	 the	 same	 way	 on	 a	 smaller
scale.	Let’s	take	a	classic	example	of	pretending	not	to	be	interested	in	a	woman
to	get	her	interested	in	you.

If	 you	 pretend	 you	 don’t	 like	 a	 woman,	 ignore	 her,	 act	 like	 what	 she	 says	 is

stupid	 or	 uninteresting,	 when	 in	 fact	 you	 do	 like	 her,	 and	 you	 are	 interested	 in
what	she	says,	subtle	cues	in	your	behavior	and	body	language	will	slowly	but
surely	 tip	 you	 off.	 The	 armor	 will	 crack.	 It	 may	 be	 laughing	 too	 much	 at	 your
own	 joke.	 Or	 tilting	 your	 head	 away	 at	 an	 awkward	 moment.	 Or	 making	 an
awkward	comment	to	her	friend	that	feels	forced.	But	people’s	bullshit	detectors
will	 eventually	 go	 off,	 and	 you’ll	 be	 exposed	 for	 not	 presenting	 an	 honest
expression	of	yourself.

But	 what	 about	 men	 who	 gush	 about	 how	 beautiful	 a	 woman	 is	 to	 flatter	 her?
What	 about	 the	 men	 who	 buy	 women	 drinks	 and	 beg	 them	 for	 dates	 and	 call
them	incessantly	and	tell	them	how	they’re	always	thinking	about	them?	Those
guys	 are	 being	 honest	 about	 their	 intentions	 and	 their	 feelings,	 but	 they’re	 not
getting	anywhere,	are	they?

Here’s	the	problem:	human	nature	is	such	that	we	don’t	trust	people	who	like	us
if	we	don’t	feel	as	though	we	earned	it	somehow.	Imagine	if	some	stranger	came
up	to	you,	started	complimenting	you	incessantly,	buying	you	things,	how	would
you	react?

You’d	probably	think	to	yourself,	“OK,	what’s	this	guy	selling?”	Or	maybe,	if	he
was	particularly	pushy	and	weird,	“Jesus,	is	this	guy	an	ax	murderer?”

That’s	because	they’re	showing	how	invested	they	are	in	your	approval	without
them	 actually	 knowing	 you,	 without	 them	 taking	 the	 time	 to	 connect	 with	 you
and	understand	you.	And	as	a	result,	you	don’t	trust	them.	You	find	them	creepy
and	weird.

Welcome	to	every	day	of	an	attractive	woman’s	life.

Men	like	this	are	broadcasting	their	neediness	like	a	giant	neon	billboard	coming
out	of	their	ass.	They	come	up	and	gush	to	a	woman	about	how	amazing	she	is
while	 they’ve	 only	 known	 her	 for	 10	 seconds.	 They	 buy	 her	 things	 with	 only
knowing	her	for	a	few	hours.	What	this	man	is	signaling	to	her	is,	“I	don’t	know
you,	 but	 I’m	 already	 going	 to	 do	 anything	 to	 win	 your	 approval,	 that’s	 how
desperate	I	am.”	And	it	comes	across	as	pathetic.

And	 even	 on	 a	 deeper	 level,	 what	 these	 men	 are	 sub-communicating	 is
something	 else:	 “The	 only	 value	 I	 have	 to	 offer	 as	 a	 man	 is	 money	 and
compliments.	I	have	nothing	else	going	for	me.”

A	man	with	an	attractive	and	interesting	lifestyle,	a	man	with	high	standards	for
himself	 and	 the	 relationships	 in	 his	 life,	 will	 take	 the	 time	 to	 get	 to	 know	 an
attractive	 woman	 before	 soliciting	 her	 with	 gifts.	 He	 will	 wait	 until	 he	 feels
strongly	enough	to	genuinely	give	her	a	compliment.	And	if	he	talks	to	her	and
discovers	that	there	is	little	that	is	interesting	about	her	beyond	her	looks,	then	he
will	lose	interest.

Ironically,	it’s	these	high	standards	and	self-regard	that	women	pick	 up	on	and
find	incredibly	sexy.	And	it’s	these	same	standards	and	self-regard	that	most	men
spend	a	lot	of	time	trying	to	fake.

When	in	doubt,	check	your	intentions.

Think	 about	 it:	 the	 average	 guy	 at	 the	 bar	 who	 goes	 around	 buying	 cute	 girls
drinks	 —	 why	 is	 he	 buying	 them?	 So	 the	 girls	 will	 sit	 there	 and	 talk	 to	 him.
When	he	comments	on	how	beautiful	they	are	and	how	he’s	so	infatuated	with
them,	why	is	he	complimenting	them?	So	that	they’ll	like	him.	When	he	pays	for
fancy	dinners	and	offers	to	buy	them	jewelry,	why	is	he	doing	it?	So	they’ll	be
impressed	with	him	and	not	leave	him.

These	 are	 not	 gifts	 or	 compliments	 at	 all.	 These	 are	 deals	 he’s	 brokering.	 The
terms	 may	 be	 implied	 or	 unspoken,	 but	 they’re	 transactions	 all	 the	 same.
Everything	 he	 gives	 to	 her,	 he	 is	 giving	 with	 the	 expectation	 to	 receive
something	in	return.	The	drinks	are	not	unconditional.	They’re	bought	with	the
provision	that	she	stays	and	talks	to	him.	The	compliments	are	spoken	with	the
provision	that	she	shows	him	affection	in	return.

And	when	the	women	don’t	show	appreciation	or	don’t	reciprocate	interest,	he
becomes	furious,	blaming	the	women	for	being	gold-digging,	lying	whores	and
bitches.	 Again,	 being	 a	 “nice	 guy”	 is	 never	 much	 different	 than	 being	 a
narcissist.	One	only	gives.	The	other	only	takes.	But	both	are	the	same	in	their
desperation	for	approval.

This	is	a	subtle	form	of	manipulation	and,	therefore,	at	its	core,	dishonest.

Once	 again,	 most	 high	 value,	 confident	 women	 will	 see	 through	 this
immediately	and	not	hang	around	a	man	who	does	this.	In	fact,	the	only	women
who	 will	 go	 for	 a	 man	 like	 this	 are	 women	 who	 are	 superficial	 and	 willing	 to
trade	 their	 affection	 for	 material	 and	 superficial	 gain	 —	 these	 women	 are
soulless	and	suppress	their	emotions	as	much,	if	not	more	than	the	men	who	buy

things	for	them.

An	 attractive	 man	 expresses	 his	 interest	 unconditionally,	 expecting	 nothing	 in
return.	 This	 arouses	 women	 and	 when	 they	 do	 reciprocate	 his	 interest,	 their
interest	is,	in	fact,	a	gift	in	return.

True	honesty	is	only	possible	when	it	is	unconditional.	The	truth	is	only	the	truth
when	it	is	given	as	a	gift	—	when	nothing	is	expected	in	return.	When	I	tell	a	girl
that	she	is	beautiful,	I	say	it	not	expecting	anything	in	return.	Whether	she	rejects
me	or	falls	in	love	with	me	isn’t	important	in	that	moment.	What’s	important	is
that	I’m	expressing	my	feelings	to	her	in	that	moment.

I	don’t	use	my	compliments	as	a	bargaining	tool.	I	give	them	unconditionally.	A
needy	 man	 will	 give	 a	 woman	 a	 compliment	 without	 knowing	 her	 and	 wait
expectantly	 for	 her	 to	 repay	 him	 in	 either	 her	 company	 or	 with	 thanks	 or	 with
sexual	favors.	I	will	give	compliments	only	when	I	am	honestly	inspired	to	give
them,	and	usually	after	already	meeting	a	woman	and	displaying	to	her	that	I’m
willing	 to	 disagree	 with	 her,	 willing	 to	 be	 rejected	 by	 her	 and	 willing	 to	 walk
away	from	her	if	it	ever	comes	to	that.	This	willingness	to	walk	away	from	her
and	this	ability	to	accept	nothing	in	return	is	what	gives	my	genuine	interest	so
much	value.

When	a	compliment	comes	from	a	man	seeking	nothing	in	return,	it’s	a	gift	of
truth,	a	piece	of	his	vulnerability	and	infinitely	more	powerful	as	a	result.

And	this	honest	compliment	inspires	women	to	become	more	highly	invested	in
return.	Paradoxically,	seeking	no	investment	from	her	will	inspire	her	to	invest
that	much	more	in	you.

Beautiful	 women	 are	 complimented	 on	 their	 looks	 often,	 and	 99%	 of	 these
compliments	are	given	out	of	neediness,	out	of	some	idealization	of	who	she	is
or	what	she	can	do	for	him.

Beautiful	women	have	been	conditioned	for	most	of	their	lives	to	know	when	a
man	is	being	genuine	or	not,	whether	the	compliment	is	a	gift	or	a	bartering	tool.

And	 when	 it	 is	 a	 gift,	 when	 it	 is	 honest,	 she	 recognizes	 and	 appreciates	 a	 man
who	genuinely	appreciates	her.	These	men	are	rare.

Women	are	people	too	(radical	idea,	I	know).	And	as	people,	we	all	value	those

who	genuinely	value	us,	not	expecting	something	in	return.

The	biggest	aphrodisiac	in	the	world	is	someone	who	likes	you,	genuinely	likes
you.	A	woman’s	desire	is	to	be	desired.	But	it	has	to	be	genuine	desire.	It	can’t
be	a,	“I’ll	desire	you	as	long	as	you	boost	my	ego	and	impress	my	co-workers,”
kind	of	desire.

The	 point	 is	 that	 genuine	 no-strings-attached	 appreciation	 is	 rare	 in	 this	 world,
particularly	from	men.	Women	value	this	and	invest	themselves	in	the	rare	man
who	can	demonstrate	his	vulnerability	to	her.

Here’s	the	litmus	test.	Look	at	your	actions	and	words	around	women	and	look
at	 the	 intentions	 behind	 them.	 These	 intentions	 are	 always	 speaking	 ten	 times
louder	than	your	actual	words.	What	are	they	saying?

If	you	bought	a	girl	a	drink	so	that	she	wouldn’t	leave	to	talk	to	someone	else,
what	 does	 that	 intention	 say	 about	 you?	 It	 says	 you	 were	 over-invested	 in	 her
and	behaving	in	a	manner	that	was	not	attractive.

If	you	told	a	girl	a	story	in	order	to	impress	her	and	make	her	like	you,	what	does
that	intention	say	about	you?	It	says	you	were	over-invested	and	behaving	in	a
manner	that	was	not	attractive.

If	you	invited	a	woman	to	a	restaurant	in	order	to	impress	her	with	how	much
money	you	had,	what	does	that	intention	say	about	you?	It	says	you	were	over-
invested	and	behaving	in	a	manner	that	was	not	attractive.

A	man	who	feels	like	he	needs	to	buy	or	steal	a	woman’s	attention	or	affection
through	entertainment,	money	or	superficiality	is	a	man	who	is	not	confident	in
his	identity	and	who	is	not	genuinely	attractive.

I	 should	 add	 that	 these	 aren’t	 all-or-nothing	 propositions	 either.	 Look,	 we	 all
want	 people	 to	 like	 us,	 and	 we	 all	 like	 to	 impress	 others.	 We	 all	 need	 some
validation	sometimes.	We	all	do	these	things	to	certain	degrees.	It’s	impossible
to	be	perfectly	non-needy	all	the	time.

But	 neediness	 is	 relative.	 That’s	 why	 I	 say	 it’s	 about	 being	 less	 invested	 in
others’	 perceptions	 instead	 of	 NOT	 invested	 in	 others’	 perceptions.	 It’s	 an
important	difference.

I’m	 not	 advising	 to	 become	 a	 heartless	 sociopath.	 Quite	 the	 opposite,	 really.
Because	the	more	you	invest	in	yourself,	the	freer	you	will	become	to	care	for
others	around	you	without	looking	for	anything	in	response.	A	man	who	is	needy
and	 does	 not	 invest	 in	 himself	 is	 ultimately	 only	 capable	 of	 superficial
interactions	because	his	threshold	for	vulnerability	is	so	low.

It’s	 impossible	 to	 be	 completely	 devoid	 of	 investment	 in	 other	 people.	 That’s
how	 we’re	 wired.	 But	 it	 is	 always	 possible	 to	 invest	 and	 care	 about	 yourself
more.

Setting	Boundaries

But	 delivering	 honesty	 unconditionally	 isn’t	 just	 about	 compliments	 and
appreciation.	Unconditional	honesty	can	be	brutal	and	scathing	at	times	as	well.
And	 strangely	 enough,	 brutal	 and	 angry	 honesty	 can	 turn	 a	 woman	 on	 just	 as
much	as	the	most	genuine	compliment.

Again,	 it’s	 not	 about	 what’s	 being	 said,	 it’s	 about	 the	 intention	 and	 sub-
communication	behind	it.	When	you’re	willing	to	cut	a	woman	off	and	tell	her
when	you	feel	that	she’s	out	of	line,	when	you’re	willing	to	tell	a	woman	what
you	 will	 and	 will	 not	 tolerate	 in	 your	 life,	 this	 sub-communicates	 the	 most
powerful	 elements	 of	 attraction	 to	 her.	 Far	 more	 powerful	 than	 an	 entertaining
story	or	game.

This	is	why	it’s	quite	possible	to	piss	a	woman	off	and	turn	her	on	at	the	same
time.	Any	man	experienced	with	women	will	be	familiar	with	this.

If	 a	 beautiful	 woman	 says	 something	 that	 a	 needy	 man	 finds	 offensive,	 he’ll
ignore	 it,	 change	 the	 topic,	 or	 withhold	 his	 true	 feelings.	 Hell,	 he	 might	 even
pretend	to	go	along	with	her	for	fear	of	making	her	upset.

But	a	non-needy	man	will	tell	her	what	she	just	said	was	offensive.	Let	the	chips
fall	where	they	may.	He	won’t	be	an	asshole	about	it.	He	will	simply	draw	a	line
in	the	sand,	“I	don’t	like	stuff	like	that,”	and	she	can	choose	to	step	across	it	or
not.

Narcissistic	 men	 often	 misconstrue	 this	 as	 a	 free	 ticket	 to	 tell	 people	 they’re
always	wrong	or	to	basically	do	what	they	want	without	paying	attention	to	the
feelings	of	others.

That’s	 over-compensation	 and	 actually	 the	 behavior	 of	 someone	 who	 is	 over-
invested	and	validated	by	the	reactions	of	those	around	him.

A	non-needy	man	does	not	seek	to	impose	himself	on	the	boundaries	of	others,
he’s	 merely	 interested	 in	 maintaining	 his	 own	 boundaries	 while	 respecting	 the
boundaries	of	others.

Non-neediness	means	you	respect	yourself	AND	others.	Narcissism	means	you
only	respect	yourself.	Neediness	means	you	only	respect	others.

The	 difference	 is	 that	 if	 a	 woman	 says	 something	 offensive,	 a	 narcissistic	 man
will	berate	her	and	try	to	get	her	to	change	her	mind,	whereas	a	non-needy	man
will	 simply	 make	 it	 clear	 that	 he	 found	 what	 she	 said	 offensive	 and	 will	 not
tolerate	it	again.	How	she	responds	is	her	choice.

If	a	woman	insults	a	non-needy	man’s	friends,	he	will	not	hesitate	to	tell	her	to
stop	and	stand	up	for	those	he	cares	about.	If	a	woman	says	she	needs	to	leave	a
date	after	30	minutes,	he	will	not	try	to	trick	her	into	staying	or	beg	her	to	come
back,	 he	 will	 not	 yell	 at	 her	 or	 lecture	 her	 on	 manners.	 He	 will	 smile	 and	 say,
“Nice	meeting	you,”	and	let	it	go.

Hold	your	line.	Don’t	go	around	breaking	somebody	else’s.

Most	questions	or	problems	men	email	me	with,	at	their	core,	somehow	involve
a	 failure	 to	 maintain	 their	 boundaries.	 Whether	 it’s	 about	 a	 date,	 a	 woman	 not
calling	 him	 back,	 a	 woman	 making	 fun	 of	 his	 job,	 or	 whatever,	 his	 perceived
“problem”	 is	 simply	 him	 not	 stepping	 up	 and	 telling	 her	 what	 he’s	 willing	 to
accept	and	not	willing	to	accept	in	his	relationships.

Typically	it	has	to	do	with	something	like	the	following:

“She	 really	 liked	 me	 and	 gave	 me	 her	 number.	 She	 responds	 to	 my	 texts,	 but
when	 I	 tried	 to	 get	 her	 out	 on	 a	 date,	 she	 made	 excuses.	 So	 then	 I	 texted	 her
some	more	and	she	said	she	wanted	to	see	me,	but	when	she	did	show	up	for	the
second	date,	she	was	late	and	said	she	had	to	go	early.	She	didn’t	kiss	me.	Now
I’m	 texting	 her	 and	 she’s	 texting	 back	 but	 won’t	 agree	 to	 go	 on	 a	 third	 date.
What	do	I	do?”

Usually,	 men	 like	 this	 are	 obsessive	 about	 “the	 games	 women	 play”	 or	 how	 to
deal	with	“tests”	from	women.

My	 answer	 to	 these	 men	 is	 always	 the	 same:	 if	 you	 make	 it	 clear	 from	 the
beginning	 that	 you	 are	 unwilling	 to	 put	 up	 with	 games,	 then	 not	 only	 will	 the
women	you	attract	stop	playing	games,	but	you’ll	stop	attracting	women	who	do.

In	 the	 example	 above,	 my	 plan	 of	 action?	 I	 would	 have	 said	 to	 her,	 “Let	 me
know	when	you’d	like	to	get	together	again.	If	you’re	not	interested,	that’s	fine
too.”

Yes,	I	will	actually	say	this	to	her.	Not	in	a	harsh	manner.	But	in	a	clear	manner.

I’ve	said	something	similar	to	women	probably	5-10	times.	Without	exception,
they’re	completely	stunned.	Often,	they	immediately	apologize	and	say	that	they
didn’t	 mean	 to	 be	 so	 flakey.	 Oddly	 enough,	 my	 honesty	 and	 complete
willingness	to	be	rejected	(or	to	reject	them)	demonstrates	my	non-neediness	and
often	it	causes	them	to	become	more	attracted	to	me.

And	a	couple	times,	they’ve	said,	“You’re	right.	I	don’t	want	to	date	you,”	in	so
many	 words.	 And	 that’s	 OK.	 Yeah,	 it	 hurt	 to	 hear	 that.	 But	 a	 lot	 of	 shit	 in	 life
hurts.	 Get	 over	 it.	 It’s	 for	 the	 better.	 She	 just	 saved	 us	 both	 a	 lot	 of	 time	 and
effort.

Your	ability	and	willingness	to	establish	boundaries	is	inversely	proportional	to
how	 needy	 you	 are.	 Men	 who	 are	 needy	 and	 lack	 vulnerability	 will	 keep	 their
boundaries	 loose	 and	 open,	 inviting	 manipulation	 into	 their	 lives	 and	 allowing
people	 to	 walk	 over	 them.	 This	 is	 because	 they	 are	 more	 than	 willing	 to	 alter
themselves	in	order	to	receive	validation	from	the	women	they	meet.

Men	who	are	non-needy	establish	strict	boundaries	because	they	value	their	own
time	and	happiness	more	than	receiving	attention	from	a	woman.	They	also	see
no	reason	to	trample	over	other	people’s	boundaries.

When	 it	 comes	 to	 making	 yourself	 more	 vulnerable,	 the	 first	 step	 is	 often	 to
begin	 establishing	 your	 own	 boundaries.	 Learn	 how	 to	 say	 no	 to	 people,
particularly	women.	Start	having	opinions	on	what	you	like	and	don’t	like,	what
you’ll	tolerate	and	won’t	tolerate.	Be	honest	with	yourself,	painfully	honest.	And
then	be	painfully	honest	with	her.

The	problem	with	forming	strong	boundaries	is	that	in	order	to	form	them,	you
have	to	be	particularly	aware	of	your	own	desires	and	emotions.	And	many	men
who	have	been	needy	their	entire	lives	are	not	very	self-aware.	They	don’t	know

what	they’re	willing	to	stand	up	for	and	what	they’re	willing	to	let	slide.	They
don’t	know	their	own	emotional	motivations	and	desires.

Men	will	often	have	to	spend	a	lot	of	time	seeking	truth	within	themselves	first
before	they’re	able	to	express	it	to	others.

Finding	Your	Truth

Here	are	some	truths	that	I’ve	found	out	about	myself:

My	overwhelming	desire	for	affection	from	women	probably	has	a	lot	to	do	with
the	fact	that	I	was	raised	by	a	single	mom	in	adolescence.	My	parents’	divorce
left	 a	 deep-seated	 fear	 of	 commitment	 in	 me	 that	 permeated	 all	 of	 my
relationships	 into	 my	 30s.	 That	 a	 lot	 of	 what	 I	 considered	 cool	 when	 I	 was
younger	 was	 really	 just	 different	 ways	 to	 protect	 myself	 and	 medicate	 my
emotional	wounds.	That	I	resented	my	dad	for	a	long	time.	That	I	have	a	peculiar
obsession	 with	 my	 masculinity.	 That	 my	 most	 important	 values	 are	 honesty,
empathy,	 and	 intellectual	 curiosity.	 That	 I’m	 unwilling	 to	 tolerate	 women	 who
don’t	make	me	happy,	no	matter	how	hot	they	are.

It’s	easy	for	me	to	say	these	things	now,	and	what’s	important	is	not	the	words.
What’s	 important	 is	 the	 floodgates	 of	 emotions	 that	 came	 up	 as	 I	 discovered
these	truths	about	myself.	As	I	discovered	these	things	about	myself,	it	allowed
me	to	express	previously	stifled	emotions	in	my	daily	life	and	with	women.

Because	as	I’ve	discovered	each	one	of	the	above	truths	about	myself,	I’ve	then
been	able	to	draw	boundaries	based	on	that	truth,	which	in	turn	makes	me	less
needy.

For	instance,	when	I	first	started	going	out,	I	spent	a	lot	of	time	beating	my	head
against	a	wall	trying	to	pick	up	the	“hot”	club	girls	at	loud	nightclubs.	You	know,
fake	tans,	fake	tits,	fake	hair,	fake	personalities.

For	 whatever	 reason,	 I	 couldn’t	 keep	 their	 attention	 long	 enough.	 Eventually,
after	 pushing	 things	 further	 and	 spending	 more	 time	 and	 effort	 in	 those	 places
than	I	care	to	admit,	I	went	home	with	a	few	of	them.

And...	well,	it	was	pretty	disappointing.

What	 I	 discovered	 is	 that	 there	 was	 not	 anything	 objectively	 better	 or	 more
interesting	about	these	girls.	The	only	thing	that	seems	to	attract	men	to	them	is
the	 fact	 that	 they	 look	 like	 women	 they	 see	 on	 TV	 and	 movies	 and	 in	 porn.
There’s	nothing	genuinely	enticing	about	them	other	than	that	they	are	seen	as	a
status	 symbol.	 And	 chasing	 them	 was	 borne	 out	 of	 neediness,	 not	 genuine
honesty.	It	took	me	a	couple	years,	but	I	eventually	realized	that	I	was	chasing	a
status	 symbol,	 a	 pat	 on	 the	 back,	 basically	 reliving	 and	 redeeming	 all	 of	 my
failed	high	school	moments	where	the	pretty	girls	didn’t	pay	attention	to	me.

It	had	nothing	to	do	with	the	women;	it	had	everything	to	do	with	me.

Now,	when	I	meet	a	woman	at	a	place	like	that	who	doesn’t	show	me	any	depth
to	her	personality,	I’m	unwilling	to	put	any	more	effort	into	getting	to	know	her.
My	 boundary	 is	 established:	 I	 value	 curiosity,	 education,	 intelligence	 and
authenticity.	I	also	don’t	value	“fake”	looks	such	as	pounds	of	make-up,	bronzer,
hair	extensions	or	super	tight	skirts.

OK,	maybe	I	do	value	the	tight	skirts.

But	 the	 irony?	 Because	 that	 boundary	 is	 established,	 I’m	 not	 invested	 in	 these
women	 much	 at	 all,	 and	 as	 a	 result,	 I	 get	 more	 attention	 from	 them	 than	 ever
before.

It’s	 important	 to	 look	 at	 the	 reasons	 why	 you’re	 over-invested	 around	 women
and	have	an	honest	discussion	with	yourself	about	it	to	try	and	resolve	it.

For	 instance,	 perhaps	 you’re	 over-invested	 around	 women	 because	 you’re	 a
virgin	and	have	no	experience	with	them.	Then	you	need	to	look	at	how	being
inexperienced	 is	 causing	 you	 to	 undervalue	 yourself	 and	 seek	 validation.	 You
must	 become	 comfortable	 with	 the	 idea	 of	 being	 inexperienced	 and	 be
comfortable	admitting	that	insecurity	if	you	wish	to	gain	a	lot	of	experience.

Or	perhaps	your	ex-girlfriend	left	you	for	another	man	and	you’re	bitter.	Before
you	 can	 undo	 the	 anger	 that	 is	 causing	 you	 to	 be	 over-invested,	 you	 need	 to
come	to	terms	with	why	you’re	angry	and	accept	why	your	ex	left	you.

For	me,	a	big	part	of	this	was	accepting	that,	actually,	I	had	been	a	pretty	naive
and	shitty	boyfriend	to	my	ex-girlfriend	and	I	could	understand	why	she	would
want	 to	 leave	 me.	 I	 also	 recognized	 flaws	 and	 insecurities	 in	 her	 that	 I	 hadn’t
noticed	when	we	were	together	and	that	she	hadn’t	been	the	perfect	angel	that	I

assumed	she	was.	All	in	all,	I	came	to	terms	with	the	experience	and	the	anger
receded,	allowing	me	to	let	go	and	become	less	invested	in	women	I	dated.

Another	 example	 is	 a	 guy	 who	 has	 never	 been	 “cool”	 before.	 Perhaps	 he	 was
picked	 on	 growing	 up	 and	 made	 fun	 of	 all	 through	 high	 school.	 Maybe	 the
popular	guys	in	school	told	him	he	was	gay	and	a	pussy.

Perhaps	 now	 he’s	 older,	 better	 looking	 and	 more	 social	 and	 is	 looking	 to
compensate	 for	 all	 of	 those	 years	 of	 feeling	 insignificant.	 So	 he	 does	 it	 by
throwing	money	around	and	attracting	a	lot	of	superficial	attention.	He’s	having
fun,	but	he’s	scratching	that	itch,	he’s	finally	living	out	that	need	to	be	the	cool
and	popular	guy.	But	at	some	point,	he	has	to	come	to	terms	with	this,	accept	it,
and	become	comfortable	admitting	it.	Then	he	can	move	on.

Again,	if	you’re	only	trying	to	get	women	to	impress	other	guys,	then	you’re	not
in	a	very	good	place,	and	you	need	to	take	a	serious	look	at	your	motivations.	To
undo	 this,	 you	 must	 come	 to	 terms	 with	 why	 you’re	 seeking	 attention	 and
approval	from	other	men	—	maybe	it	goes	as	far	back	as	your	father	—	and	then
seek	to	find	that	approval	through	other	means.	Join	a	sports	team.	Take	your	co-
workers	out	for	beers.	Buy	season	tickets	to	the	local	basketball	team.	There	are
much	healthier	ways	to	get	male	camaraderie	than	to	try	and	impress	other	guys
by	getting	girls.

For	 me,	 I	 had	 a	 combination	 of	 the	 second	 two	 examples.	 I	 spent	 most	 of	 my
adolescence	living	alone	with	my	mother.	As	a	result,	I	always	related	more	to
girls	than	to	boys,	and	had	few	 male	friends	until	I	reached	adulthood.	I	 never
could	 relate	 to	 them	 as	 well,	 and	 not	 having	 my	 father	 around	 as	 much	 (both
physically	 and	 emotionally)	 drove	 me	 to	 unconsciously	 seek	 a	 lot	 of	 approval
from	other	men.

Throw	on	top	of	that	the	fact	my	girlfriend	of	four	years	left	me,	and	I	had	a	lot
of	 anger	 toward	 women.	 Combine	 the	 two	 and	 you	 have	 a	 perfect	 recipe	 for	 a
needy	man	who	turned	to	narcissism	in	order	to	over-compensate	and	become	a
player.

Recognizing	 and	 accepting	 these	 truths	 is	 the	 only	 thing	 that	 allowed	 me	 to
resolve	 and	 let	 go	 of	 a	 lot	 of	 my	 investment	 and	 neediness	 toward	 women’s
approval.	I	had	to	come	to	terms	with	these	faults	within	myself	before	I	could
finally	attract	amazing	women	into	my	life	with	consistency.	As	soon	as	my	need

to	impress	other	men	dissipated,	so	did	my	investment	in	how	a	drunken	girl	in	a
bar	thought	of	me.	As	soon	as	I	let	go	of	some	of	my	anger	towards	my	ex,	some
of	my	need	to	fuck	absolutely	everything	disappeared	too.

As	a	result,	I	became	less	invested	and	less	affected	by	the	actions	of	the	women
around	me,	which	in	turn	made	me	more	attractive	around	them.	As	if	by	magic,
I	began	to	attract	far	more	beautiful	and	interesting	women	with	less	effort.

And	 how	 do	 I	 know	 this?	 It	 was	 clear.	 My	 looks	 didn’t	 change.	 I	 dressed	 the
same	 way.	 Went	 to	 the	 same	 parties	 and	 bars.	 But	 suddenly	 women	 were
approaching	me.	I	was	catching	more	beautiful	women	smiling	at	me	and	staring
at	me.	My	outward	appearance	had	changed	little.	My	inner	disposition	changed
entirely.	My	outward	behaviors	soon	followed	suit.

Seeking	the	truth	within	yourself	is	a	long-term	progress.	An	entire	book	could
be	written	on	it	by	itself.	But	I	guarantee	that	you	have	some	deep-seated	truths
that	 are	 currently	 causing	 you	 to	 invest	 too	 heavily	 in	 how	 women	 treat	 you.
Otherwise,	you	wouldn’t	have	bought	this	book	or	read	this	far.

If	 you	 feel	 like	 you	 have	 some	 serious	 emotional	 issues	 or	 believe	 that	 for
whatever	reason	you’re	basing	an	insanely	high	amount	of	your	identity	on	how
women	respond	to	you,	then	I	recommend	therapy.

Therapy	has	a	lot	of	negative	stereotypes	and	judgments	that	come	along	with	it,
but	if	you	take	the	time	to	find	a	good	therapist	who	you	trust	and	gel	with,	then
it	can	be	extremely	helpful.

The	important	thing	about	therapy	is	to	remember	that	it’s	a	tool,	not	a	solution.
A	therapist	is	there	to	guide	you	and	motivate	you	in	continuing	to	find	your	own
emotional	 truths	 about	 yourself.	 He	 or	 she	 can’t	 find	 them	 for	 you.	 A	 lot	 of
people	show	up	to	therapy	expecting	a	therapist	to	magically	fix	them.	They	then
get	 frustrated	 when	 all	 they	 do	 is	 “talk”	 and	 get	 asked	 annoying	 questions	 the
whole	session.

Those	 questions	 are	 asked	 for	 a	 reason.	 Be	 pro-active	 in	 finding	 the	 emotional
knots	in	yourself	that	you	didn’t	know	were	there	before.	You’ll	discover	some
amazing	 things.	 That	 time	 the	 neighbor’s	 kids	 locked	 you	 in	 a	 closet	 all
afternoon,	 or	 the	 time	 your	 mother	 went	 home	 and	 forgot	 you	 at	 the	 grocery
store,	or	a	parent’s	divorce	or	death	of	a	loved	one	—	these	all	have	emotional
repercussions	 that	 can	 and	 probably	 will	 motivate	 you	 and	 drive	 you	 to	 over-

invest	in	receiving	validation	from	one	specific	source	or	another	in	your	life.

And	that	source	is	sometimes	women.

Following	the	advice	of	this	book	should	help	as	well.	All	the	advice	in	the	book
is	crafted	to	help	you	develop	non-neediness.	Implementing	these	behaviors	and
becoming	 more	 aware	 of	 your	 emotions	 while	 you’re	 doing	 them	 should	 help
you	down	the	road	to	permanent	change.

As	you’ll	see,	the	book	is	divided	up	into	three	core	areas:	building	a	congruent
and	 attractive	 lifestyle	 for	 yourself,	 overcoming	 your	 fears	 and	 anxieties,	 and
becoming	 socially	 adept	 at	 expressing	 your	 emotions	 and	 sexuality	 without
shame	or	hesitation.

All	three	of	these	sections	will	help	you	become	more	vulnerable	and	less	needy.
As	we’ll	talk	about	in	Chapter	6,	these	things	are	all	interconnected.	When	you
work	on	one	of	them,	you	indirectly	benefit	the	others,	and	vice-versa.

Friction	and	Projection

I’d	like	to	finish	up	the	chapter	discussing	a	couple	of	exceptions	when	it	comes
to	 being	 vulnerable	 and	 non-needy	 around	 women.	 I	 know	 at	 the	 beginning	 of
the	 book	 I	 made	 the	 promise	 that	 being	 less	 invested	 in	 any	 particular	 woman
than	she	is	invested	in	you	will	make	her	perceive	you	as	attractive.

Well,	that’s	true,	but	just	because	she	perceives	you	as	an	attractive	man,	doesn’t
mean	she’ll	immediately	want	to	jump	into	bed	with	you.

Attraction	is	great,	but	in	and	of	itself,	it’s	not	always	enough	to	consummate	a
romantic	or	sexual	relationship.

There	are	two	main	reasons	that	prevent	attracted	women	from	being	with	you,
and	they	are	both	quite	common:	I	call	them	friction	and	projection.

Friction	is	when	a	woman	finds	you	to	be	an	attractive	man,	but	there	are	value
differences	 or	 external	 circumstances	 that	 prevent	 her	 from	 acting	 on	 that
attraction	or	being	interested	in	you.

For	instance,	let’s	say	you’re	a	rock	star	who	spends	his	nights	getting	drunk	and

banging	 groupies	 and	 she’s	 a	 born-again	 Christian	 and	 has	 sworn	 off	 all	 sex
before	 marriage.	 That	 mismatch	 in	 personal	 values	 is	 going	 to	 disrupt	 any
potential	of	ever	being	together	and	is	a	genuine	piece	of	friction	that	is	going	to
prevent	anything	from	happening.

The	 most	 common	 case	 is	 the	 girlfriend/wife.	 This	 happens	 all	 the	 time.	 You
meet	 a	 woman,	 you	 two	 really	 click,	 she’s	 laughing	 at	 all	 your	 jokes,	 smiles
when	you	smile,	looks	into	your	eyes	a	little	bit	too	long…

…and	she’s	married.

And	not	only	is	she	married	but	she	makes	a	point	to	cut	the	flirting	off	before	it
goes	too	far.	She	likes	you.	She	may	even	say	that	she’s	attracted	to	you	and	be
honest.	But	she	values	her	marriage	more	than	her	attraction	to	you.	And	there’s
nothing	you	can	do	about	that.	That’s	friction.

Men	 often	 used	 to	 ask	 me	 how	 to	 get	 a	 woman	 to	 cheat	 on	 her	 boyfriend	 or
husband.	My	answer	has	two	parts.	The	first	part	is:	you	don’t,	they	decide.	The
second	 part	 of	 the	 answer	 is:	 don’t	 fucking	 do	 it,	 what’s	 wrong	 with	 you?	 It
contributes	to	the	fucking	of	people’s	lives	and	even	if	it	didn’t,	it’s	never	worth
the	headache	it	causes.

Friction	can	be	religious,	cultural	or	simply	due	to	poor	logistics.	For	instance,
some	legit	friction	would	be	if	she	lives	in	Australia	and	you	live	in	New	York.
That	creates	some	problems	for	dating	despite	strong	attraction.

There’s	 usually	 at	 least	 a	 little	 bit	 of	 friction	 in	 any	 interaction.	 You’re	 never
going	to	like	100%	of	any	woman	and	no	woman	is	ever	going	to	like	100%	of
you.	There	will	be	slight	differences	in	values	or	priorities	that	will	irk	you	just	a
little	 bit,	 or	 maybe	 a	 lot.	 There	 will	 also	 be	 unavoidable	 situations	 and	 events
that	will	cause	obstacles	to	you	two	being	together.

Whether	this	friction	prevents	a	sexual	relationship	from	occurring	though	will
depend	on	the	strength	of	your	boundaries	and	what	your	expectations	are.

For	instance,	you	may	meet	a	really	hot	girl	who	is	a	cocaine	addict.	But	if	you
kind	of	just	want	to	have	sex	with	her,	you	may	overlook	the	cocaine	addiction.
Then	again,	if	you	have	a	major	moral	issue	with	narcotics,	then	you’ll	probably
be	turned	off	and	pass	up	on	her.

Ultimately,	your	values	determine	your	behavior.	And	that’s	kind	of	the	point	of
all	of	this:	YOUR	values	determine	your	behavior,	not	what	you	think	she	wants,
not	 what	 you	 think	 others	 want,	 but	 what	 is	 best	 for	 you	 and	 best	 for	 the
relationship.

Projection	is	completely	different.	There	are	a	lot	of	women	who,	for	whatever
reason,	are	afraid	of	their	own	sexuality	and/or	openly	sexual	men.	They	harbor
trust	issues	and	resentment	with	men.	Usually,	this	is	because	they	have	a	history
of	some	sort	of	emotional/sexual	abuse	and/or	they’ve	experienced	a	long	string
of	disappointments	with	the	men	in	their	life.

When	 confronted	 with	 a	 non-needy	 man	 —	 a	 man	 without	 these	 similar
emotional	hang-ups	and	distrust	—	these	women	will	usually	be	untrusting	and
lash	out	in	response.	They	are	not	lashing	out	for	lack	of	attraction,	but	they	are
lashing	 out	 because	 they	 are	 attracted	 and	 that	 strong	 sexual	 attraction	 scares
them,	particularly	if	you’re	a	man	who	feels	threatening	to	them.	Their	view	of
male	 sexuality	 is	 negative	 and	 when	 they	 are	 confronted	 with	 an	 honest	 and
attractive	man	they’ll	often	attack	you	and	try	to	tear	you	down	for	it.

These	are	the	women	who	will	get	angry	and	say	snide	things	like,	“I	bet	you	say
that	to	all	the	girls,”	or	will	find	reasons	to	push	you	away	and	then	regret	it	and
want	 you	 back.	 They	 will	 pretend	 to	 miss	 your	 calls	 and	 then	 get	 angry	 when
you	don’t	persist	in	calling	them,	or	they’ll	make	up	excuses	to	ignore	you	on	a
date	and	then	get	mad	when	you	don’t	behave	like	a	gentleman.

Needless	to	say,	you’re	better	off	without	these	women.	Take	the	rejection	and
move	on.

Generally,	 these	 women	 are	 extremely	 needy,	 and	 because	 of	 the	 large
investment	 gap	 between	you	 two,	they	 will	 try	to	project	their	 own	investment
onto	 you.	 They	 will	 accuse	 you	 of	 being	 demanding,	 overbearing,	 too	 horny,
untrustworthy,	 or	 weak.	 These	 accusations	 will	 have	 little	 to	 no	 connection	 to
reality,	and	a	non-needy	man	will	either	walk	away	from	a	girl	like	this	or	simply
ignore	her	accusations	if	they	have	no	bearing.

The	 only	 men	 willing	 to	 put	 up	 with	 such	 nonsense	 are	 men	 who	 are	 highly
needy	as	well.	The	needy	man	will	spend	all	of	his	time	placating	and	trying	to
fix	 the	 accusations	 and	 problems	 the	 woman	 projects	 onto	 him.	 And	 the	 most
messed	up	part	about	this	is	that	the	needy	man	will	enjoy	fixing	and	placating

the	needy	woman.	The	needy	man	enjoys	it	because	this	constant	“fixing”	of	the
distrusting	woman’s	fears	and	accusations	makes	the	needy	man	feel	needed.

If	the	man	is	narcissistic,	then	he	will	usually	lash	out	right	back	at	the	woman
and	they	will	engage	in	a	relationship	full	of	petty,	unimportant	drama,	playing
out	emotions	and	projecting	their	histories	of	pain	and	marginalization	onto	each
other	over	and	over	again,	until	one	of	them	finally	becomes	conscious	enough
to	break	the	cycle	and	move	on.	Sometimes	this	happens	quickly.	Other	times	it
takes	months	or	years.	Either	way,	it’s	always	unpleasant.

The	 uncomfortable	 truth	 is	 that	 the	 majority	 of	 women	 are	 going	 to	 have	 high
degrees	of	friction	and	projection	when	you	meet	them.	With	most	of	the	women
you	 meet,	 things	 are	 simply	 not	 going	 to	 work	 no	 matter	 what	 you	 do	 or	 say.
This	is	to	be	expected.	And	this	is	fine.	You	are	going	to	be	incompatible	with
most	 of	 the	 women	 in	 the	 world	 and	 to	 hold	 any	 hopes	 of	 being	 highly
compatible	 with	 most	 is	 an	 illusion	 of	 grandeur	 and	 a	 figment	 of	 your	 own
narcissistic	tendency.

Incompatibility	is	a	fact	of	life.	No	matter	how	you	behave	or	what	you’re	into,
the	 majority	 of	 women	 out	 there	 at	 any	 given	 time	 are	 simply	 not	 going	 to	 be
interested	or	emotionally	available	to	you.	Our	job	is	not	to	attract	every	woman,
but	to	screen	for	women	with	a	high	potential	of	being	attracted	to	who	we	really
are.

The	 reality	 of	 incompatibility	 defines	 our	 entire	 strategy	 of	 dating	 women.	 To
base	our	strategy	on	anything	else	is	inefficient	at	best	and	downright	damaging
at	 worst.	 The	 world	 is	 what	 it	 is,	 it’s	 our	 job	 to	 simply	 present	 ourselves	 as
boldly	 and	 clearly	 to	 it	 as	 possible,	 accept	 the	 reactions	 and	 move	 on	 the
opportunities.	Any	attempt	to	control	the	reactions	of	others	or	take	some	kind	of
power	over	the	reactions	you	receive	is	both	foolish	and	illusory.

Part	II:	Strategy

Chapter	4:
Polarization

In	Part	I,	we	learned	that	male	attractiveness	is	based	on	how	non-needy	one	is
and	how	comfortable	one	is	in	expressing	one’s	desire	and	vulnerability.	We	also
learned	the	limitations	of	attraction	and	how	most	of	the	women	in	the	world	at
any	given	time	are	not	going	to	be	compatible	with	you	no	matter	what	you	say
or	do.

In	Part	II,	our	goal	is	to	create	a	real	world	strategy	based	on	these	realities	so
that	 any	 man	 can	 map	 out	 a	 clear	 way	 to	 improve	 his	 dating	 life	 quickly	 and
drastically.

The	goals	of	this	strategy	are	efficacy	and	practicality.	This	is	a	strategy	based	on
reality,	 not	 based	 on	 some	 sort	 of	 mythology	 about	 unlocking	 the	 secrets	 of
every	woman,	or	lofty	promises	to	be	able	to	sleep	with	every	single	hot	girl	you
ever	meet.

As	a	result,	the	strategy	in	this	book	deals	with	realities	that	a	lot	of	other	men’s
dating	 advice	 does	 not	 deal	 with;	 namely,	 rejection,	 race,	 age,	 appearance,
shame,	honesty,	emotional	connection	and	did	I	mention	rejection?

You	will	get	rejected.	But	don’t	worry.	It’s	a	good	thing.

A	 lot	of	dating	advice,	particularly	of	the	performance	variety,	tries	to	promise
the	ability	to	have	sex	with	any	girl	you	want,	regardless	of...	well,	pretty	much
anything.	You	could	be	a	fat	slob	living	in	your	mother’s	basement,	and	with	the
right	two	or	three	lines,	you	too	can	date	a	lingerie	model	(as	if	there’s	a	lingerie
model	hanging	out	on	every	street	corner).

This	 is	 a	 fairy	 tale.	 And	 not	 only	 is	 it	 a	 fairy	 tale,	 it’s	 a	 fairy	 tale	 you	 don’t
actually	want	to	live.	It	feeds	your	neediness.

Rejection	 exists	 for	 a	 reason	 —	 it’s	 a	 means	 to	 keep	 people	 apart	 who	 are	 not
good	for	each	other.

Men	don’t	seem	to	understand	that	if	a	woman	rejects	him	because	he’s	short,	or
because	she	doesn’t	like	his	hair,	or	because	she	finds	him	boring,	then	he	wasn’t

going	to	enjoy	being	around	her	anyway.

Ask	yourself	this:	why	would	you	want	to	be	intimate	with	someone	who	doesn't
appreciate	 you?	 Why	 would	 you	 ever	 settle	 for	 such	 a	 person?	 Because	 she's
hot?	Come	on,	have	a	little	more	self-respect.	Have	some	higher	standards.

Again,	the	men	who	are	needy	and	have	poor	self-esteem	are	the	ones	who	are
willing	to	completely	alter	their	personalities	in	order	to	seduce	any	woman.	The
first	 step	 to	 being	 more	 attractive	 is	 to	 see	 rejection	 as	 a	 means	 to	 eliminate
women	who	won't	make	you	happy	from	your	life.	It's	a	blessing,	not	a	curse.

So	let’s	start	at	the	beginning.	There	are	an	infinite	number	of	women	out	there,
and	we	can’t	possibly	meet	or	even	know	all	of	them.	So	our	first	task	is	to	find	a
way	 to	 narrow	 them	 down	 and	 screen	 them	 in	 a	 way	 that	 we	 can	 manage	 our
opportunities	better.

The	Three	Categories	of	Women

Let’s	start	with	all	of	the	women	on	the	planet.	That’s	something	like	3.6	billion
or	so.

Obviously,	you	are	not	going	to	desire	the	majority	of	the	women	in	the	world.
So	we	can	cross	out	all	of	the	ones	who	are	physically	not	to	your	taste.	If	you
don’t	 find	 a	 woman	 attractive,	 don’t	 hit	 on	 her,	 don’t	 ask	 her	 out,	 don’t	 do
anything.

That	said,	decide	whatever	you	like	in	a	woman	by	your	own	standards.	If	you
like	big	girls	or	curvy	girls,	go	for	it.	If	you	prefer	black	girls	with	dreadlocks,
more	 power	 to	 you.	 If	 you	 like	 older	 women	 or	 younger	 women,	 cool.	 Don’t
pressure	yourself	to	live	up	to	someone	else’s	standards.	And	again,	for	the	love
of	god,	if	you	don’t	find	her	attractive,	don’t	pursue	her.

For	 practical	 purposes,	 we	 can	 divide	 up	 all	 of	 the	 women	 you’re	 attracted	 to
into	three	categories:	Receptive,	Neutral	and	Unreceptive.

Let’s	start	with	Unreceptive.

Women	 who	 are	 Unreceptive	 are	 just	 that:	 they’re	 unavailable	 and/or
uninterested	 in	 having	 a	 sexual/romantic	 relationship	 with	 you.	 The	 most

common	reasons	that	put	women	in	this	category	are	the	following:

-	You’re	far	needier	than	she	is,	and	she’s	therefore	not	attracted	to	you.
-	She	has	a	boyfriend/husband	and	is	happy	in	her	relationship.
-	There’s	too	much	friction	preventing	her	from	being	willing	to	date	you,
such	as	a	difference	in	values,	difference	in	interests,	bad	logistics,	etc.
-	She’s	not	interested	or	looking	for	any	man	at	the	moment.

The	 way	 to	 tell	 if	 a	 woman	 is	 Unreceptive	 is	 if	 she	 repeatedly	 does	 not
reciprocate	 your	 signs	 of	 interest	 and/or	 shows	 you	 signs	 of	 disinterest.	 If	 you
invite	 her	 out	 for	 coffee	 and	 she	 keeps	 making	 excuses	 to	 why	 she	 can’t,	 then
she’s	Unreceptive.	If	you	call	her	three	times	and	she	never	calls	back,	then	she
is	Unreceptive.	If	you	chat	her	up	and	she	explains	that	she	is	busy	and	wants	to
be	alone,	then	she	is	Unreceptive.	If	you	hang	out	with	her	and	she	talks	about
how	 frustrated	 she	 is	 with	 her	 boyfriend	 and	 how	 you’re	 such	 a	 good	 listener,
then	she’s	Unreceptive.

No	 exceptions.	 Many	 men	 waste	 a	 lot	 of	 time	 convincing	 themselves	 that
Unreceptive	 women	 may	 actually	 like	 them.	 A	 good	 rule	 of	 thumb	 here	 is,	 “if
you	have	to	ask,	then	that’s	your	answer.”	That	is,	there	should	be	no	ambiguity
here.	And	if	there	is,	you	can	quickly	solve	it	by	simply	stating	to	her,	“I	think
you’re	 cute/pretty/attractive/funny/whatever,	 want	 to	 grab	 coffee/dinner/a	 drink
sometime?”

Problem	solved.	You’ll	find	out	where	you	are	very	quickly.

But	I’m	getting	ahead	of	myself…

The	 next	 category	 is	 Neutral.	 This	 category	 can	 be	 difficult	 for	 men	 to
understand	 because	 it’s	 not	 as	 common	 for	 us	 as	 it	 is	 for	 women.	 Typically,	 a
man	knows	within	a	few	seconds	if	he’s	willing	to	meet	and	even	sleep	with	a
woman	or	not.

Women	aren’t	like	that.	They	spend	a	lot	of	time	being	unsure	about	a	man	and
need	to	be	swayed	one	way	or	the	other.

Women	 in	 this	 category	 are	 usually	 women	 who	 you’ve	 just	 met	 or	 have	 only
spent	a	little	bit	of	time	with.	The	important	thing	to	know	is	that	women	do	not
ever	stay	in	this	category.	They	eventually	polarize	one	way	or	the	other.	And	if
you	 never	 make	 an	 advance	 or	 show	 interest	 in	 them,	 then	 they	 will	 usually

polarize	towards	being	Unreceptive	(this	is	the	Friend	Zone,	which	we’ll	cover
in	a	minute).

Neutral	 women	 are	 generally	 just	 that,	 neutral.	 They	 will	 not	 necessarily	 turn
down	your	offers,	but	they	won’t	offer	or	reciprocate	themselves.	The	jury’s	still
out.	 They’ll	 often	 tentatively	 say	 yes,	 although	 they	 won’t	 seem	 overly
enthusiastic	 about	 it.	 They’re	 still	 testing	 the	 waters.	 Or	 sometimes,	 they	 just
haven’t	considered	you	in	that	way	yet.

The	 goal	 with	 Neutral	 women	 is	 to	 polarize	 them	 through	 your	 words	 and
behaviors.	 This	 may	 mean	 flirting	 with	 them	 or	 teasing	 them.	 It	 may	 mean
asking	her	on	a	date.	It	may	be	as	simple	as	smiling	at	her	from	across	the	room.
Whatever	it	is,	the	goal	with	Neutral	women	is	to	take	an	action	that	forces	her
to	make	a	decision	about	how	she	feels	about	you.	Which	side	she	polarizes	to	is
far	less	important	than	actually	taking	action.	And	remember,	if	you	leave	her	to
her	 neutrality,	 she	 will	 usually	 become	 Unreceptive	 and	 not	 see	 you	 as	 dating
material.

And	 in	 the	 final	 category,	 women	 who	 are	 Receptive	 are	 women	 who	 are
sexually/romantically	 attracted	 to	 you.	 You	 can	 recognize	 women	 who	 are
Receptive	in	two	ways:	1)	they	initiate	with	you,	and/or	2)	they	reciprocate	your
actions	enthusiastically.

Some	examples	of	a	woman	initiating	with	you:

-	She	makes	strong	eye	contact	with	you	and	doesn’t	break	it.
-	She	approaches	you.
-	She	touches	you	unprovoked.
-	She	asks	for	your	number	or	invites	you	out	with	her/her	friends.
-	 She	 asks	 you	 a	 lot	 of	 questions	 about	 yourself	 and	 seems	 genuinely
interested	in	you.
-	She	introduces	you	to	her	friends.
-	She	gives	you	her	number.
-	She	comes	up	with	some	excuse/story/reason	for	you	to	hang	out	with	her
or	spend	time	with	her.

Chances	 are	 if	 you’re	 reading	 this	 book,	 many	 of	 the	 girlfriends	 or	 sexual
experiences	 you’ve	 had	 with	 women	 in	 the	 past	 only	 happened	 because	 she
initiated	with	you.

That’s	 fine.	 But	 just	 going	 about	 your	 life,	 unless	 you	 are	 extremely	 good-
looking	 or	 have	 a	 great	 lifestyle	 or	 you	 manage	 to	 meet	 women	 through	 good
social	 contacts,	 few	 women	 are	 going	 to	 initiate	 with	 you	 and	 the	 few	 who	 do
won’t	initiate	often.

In	fact,	most	women,	especially	very	beautiful	women,	even	if	they’re	attracted
to	 you,	 won’t	 initiate	 with	 you.	 Remember,	 women	 tend	 to	 be	 less	 invested
before	 sex,	 therefore,	 they	 (usually)	 expect	 men	 to	 initiate	 in	 the	 beginning.
There	are	also	strong	cultural	pressures	on	women	to	wait	for	the	man	to	initiate.

The	 other	 way	 women	 demonstrate	 that	 they’re	 Receptive	 is	 when	 they
reciprocate.	 It’s	 important	 to	 recognize	 the	 subtle	 difference	 between	 a	 woman
reciprocating	your	advances	and	a	woman	being	neutral	toward	your	advances.
A	 woman	 who	 is	 Neutral	 will	 simply	 not	 respond	 at	 all.	 For	 instance,	 if	 you
touch	a	Neutral	woman	on	her	back	while	you	speak	to	her,	she’ll	just	act	like
you’re	not	touching	her.

A	woman	who	is	reciprocating	will	do	something	to	respond	positively	to	your
advance.	Think	of	it	as	her	signaling	to	you	that	she	accepts	your	advancing	on
her	 and	 likes	 it.	 If	 you	 touched	 a	 woman	 on	 the	 back	 and	 she	 wanted	 to
reciprocate,	she	would	either	lean	back	into	you,	lean	in	closer	to	you,	or	touch
you	in	return.

Here	are	some	other	common	examples	of	reciprocation:

-	She	ignores	her	friends	to	stay	and	talk	to	you.
-	 She	 keeps	 very	 strong	 eye	 contact	 and	 laughs	 a	 little	 too	 much	 at
everything	you	say.
-	When	you	touch	her,	she	touches	you	in	return.
-	When	you	put	your	arm	around	her,	she	leans	into	you.
-	When	you	take	her	hand	to	move	somewhere,	she	holds	it	in	return.
-	 When	 you	 ask	 her	 out	 on	 a	 date,	 she	 offers	 a	 place	 to	 go	 or	 mentions
something	she’d	like	to	do	with	you.

Most	 interested	 women	 will	 reciprocate	 on	 small	 signals	 to	 show	 that	 they’re
interested	 in	 you.	 Catching	 on	 to	 how	 women	 reciprocate	 and	 noticing	 the
signals	 is	 something	 that	 you	 develop	 with	 experience,	 but	 it	 shouldn’t	 be	 too
hard	if	you	know	what	to	pay	attention	to.

A	 lot	 of	 the	 methods	 of	 flirting	 that	 we’ll	 cover	 in	 Part	 V	 will	 address	 the

specific	ways	in	which	women	reciprocate	and	how	to	handle	them.

Unfortunately,	 the	 vast	 majority	 of	 women	 you	 will	 meet,	 assuming	 you’re	 a
typical	guy,	will	be	either	Neutral	or	Unreceptive.	This	is	true	for	the	most	of	the
male	population,	myself	included,	so	don’t	worry.

The	percentage	of	women	that	you	meet	in	each	category	will	vary	widely	from
man	to	man	and	also	vary	widely	depending	on	the	context	in	which	you	meet
women.

For	 instance,	 you	 could	 be	 a	 40-year-old	 investing	 mogul,	 and	 at	 networking
events	or	conferences,	you	may	find	that	40%	or	more	women	are	Receptive	and
few	make	themselves	Unreceptive	or	Neutral.

But	that	same	man	can	go	to	a	nightclub	full	of	drunken	20-year-olds	and	soon
find	that	only	1%	of	women	are	Receptive	or	Neutral,	and	99%	are	Unreceptive.

This	 is	 a	 concept	 I	 call	 Demographics,	 and	 I’ve	 devoted	 all	 of	 Chapter	 7	 to	 it
because	it’s	extremely	important.

The	 exact	 percentages	 of	 women	 falling	 into	 each	 category	 aren’t	 really	 that
relevant.	A	lot	of	men,	and	even	a	lot	of	dating	advice	books,	misplace	a	lot	of
time	and	effort	due	to	not	understanding	these	three	categories	and	the	strategies
that	go	along	with	them.

Strategies	for	Each	Category

Your	 course	 of	 action	 will	 differ	 depending	 on	 the	 type	 of	 woman	 you	 meet.
Many	 men	 make	 the	 mistake	 of	 applying	 the	 wrong	 strategy	 to	 the	 wrong
category	of	women.	For	instance,	they’ll	try	to	convince	an	Unreceptive	woman
to	become	Receptive.	Or	they’ll	treat	a	woman	who’s	already	Receptive	as	if	she
isn’t	yet.	Not	only	is	this	a	time	waster,	it’s	also	ineffective.

The	goal	with	Unreceptive	women	is	to	identify	them	and	move	on	as	quickly	as
possible.	 They’re	 time	 sinks.	 Typically,	 if	 women	 are	 Unreceptive,	 they’re
Unreceptive	for	a	good	reason,	and	it	has	little	to	do	with	you	(or	maybe	it	does
has	everything	to	do	with	you,	in	which	case	you	should	learn	from	it).

You’re	 almost	 never	 going	 to	 change	 the	 mind	 of	 an	 Unreceptive	 woman,	 and

even	when	you	do	it’s	often	not	worth	the	effort.

I	strongly	believe	in	the	idea	of	“Fuck	Yes	or	No.”	That	is,	I	want	women	to	say
“Fuck	Yes,”	once	they’ve	gotten	to	know	me.	And	if	they	aren’t	enthusiastic	and
excited	 about	 being	 with	 me,	 then	 I’m	 not	 interested	 in	 them	 anymore.	 So
Unreceptive	women	simply	aren’t	worth	my	time	or	effort	to	pursue.	They	could
be	 great	 people	 and	 maybe	 I’ll	 be	 friends	 with	 them.	 But	 the	 minute	 they’re
Unreceptive	towards	me,	my	interests	have	moved	on.

I’ll	 say	 this:	 in	 seven	 years,	 after	 meeting	 thousands	 of	 women,	 I	 can	 think	 of
maybe	five	instances	where	a	woman	was	flat	out	Unreceptive	towards	me	and	I
“won	her	over.”	If	she	shuts	you	down,	tells	you	to	go	away,	tells	you	she’s	not
interested,	 tells	 you	 she	 has	 a	 boyfriend,	 move	 on.	 Seriously,	 get	 over	 it	 and
move	on.	You’re	wasting	your	time.	I	don’t	care	how	special	you	think	she	is,
there’s	another	one	out	there	who’s	just	as	special	who	will	be	Receptive	to	you.

The	two	most	common	time	sinks	with	Unreceptive	Women	are	the	Friend	Zone
and	women	in	relationships.

The	Friend	Zone	occurs	when	a	woman	has	categorized	you	as	a	friend	and	not	a
potential	 lover.	 For	 women,	 these	 categories	 are	 almost	 always	 mutually
exclusive.	A	man	is	either	a	friend,	or	a	potential	sexual	partner,	but	rarely	both.
There	are	exceptions,	but	they	are	rare.

Once	inside	of	it,	the	Friend	Zone	is	almost	impossible	to	get	out.	And	if	you	do
ever	 get	 out,	 it’s	 likely	 not	 due	 to	 anything	 you	 tried	 or	 did	 anyway.	 Why?
Because	 a	 man	 who	 does	 not	 act	 on	 his	 sexual	 desires	 is	 a	 man	 who	 is	 needy,
lacks	vulnerability	and	is	therefore	unattractive.

The	 Friend	 Zone	 typically	 occurs	 when	 a	 man	 meets	 a	 Receptive	 or	 Neutral
woman	 but	 never	 makes	 a	 move	 or	 expresses	 his	 interest.	 Instead,	 he	 behaves
pleasantly,	like	a	good	friend	would.	In	his	mind,	this	is	great	because	it	means
she	 likes	 talking	 to	 him,	 laughs	 at	 his	 jokes,	 etc.	 But	 because	 he’s	 withholding
his	sexual	interest,	he’s	placing	himself	in	her	mind	firmly	in	the	“friend”	camp.

A	classic,	yet	painful	example	of	the	Friend	Zone	happened	with	a	friend	of	my
ex-girlfriend.	 When	 I	 met	 her,	 she	 was	 moving	 into	 her	 new	 apartment.	 There
were	 two	 guys	 helping	 her	 move	 in.	 One	 was	 a	 tall	 fellow	 who	 obviously
seemed	eager	to	please	her	and	help	as	much	as	he	could.	It	did	not	take	long	to
recognize	 that	 he	 was	 quite	 needy	 around	 her	 and	 made	 poor	 attempts	 to	 flirt,

which	she	did	not	reciprocate.

She,	 of	 course,	 being	 an	 attractive	 girl,	 was	 not	 highly	 invested	 back,	 and	 so	 I
immediately	pegged	him	as	in	her	Friend	Zone.	As	it	turned	out,	I	was	right.

This	guy	hated	me	the	whole	time	I	dated	her.	He	was	convinced	that	I	was	an
asshole	 because	 he	 had	 been	 so	 nice	 to	 her	 for	 so	 long,	 and	 I	 came	 along	 and
simply	 asked	 her	 out	 without	 giving	 a	 shit	 whether	 she	 said	 yes	 or	 not.	 Funny
how	 that	 works.	 A	 couple	 years	 later,	 after	 she	 and	 I	 broke	 up	 and	 remained
friends,	 he	 refused	 to	 let	 her	 talk	 about	 me	 around	 him.	 During	 this	 period,	 he
made	 numerous	 attempts	 to	 get	 with	 her,	 sometimes	 going	 as	 far	 as	 making
tearful	proclamations	that	he	had	been	in	love	with	her	for	years.

Needless	to	say,	all	of	these	attempts	turned	her	off	and	she	shut	down.	It	ruined
the	friendship.	They	had	been	friends	with	each	other	for	over	four	years,	and	the
degree	of	investment	he	was	showing,	even	despite	his	behavior	(the	fact	that	he
spent	 four	 years	 working	 up	 the	 nerve	 to	 make	 a	 move)	 sub-communicated	 a
massive	degree	of	neediness	and	horrible	self-worth.

Obviously,	she	rejected	him.	Again	and	again,	she	rejected	him.	So	he	became
angry.	And	perceiving	me	to	have	been	an	asshole	who	didn’t	treat	her	well,	he
decided	to	try	to	be	an	asshole	who	didn’t	treat	her	well	either.	He	went	down	the
road	 of	 narcissism	 and	 overcompensation.	 He	 began	 to	 behave	 disrespectfully
towards	her,	believing	that	she	must	have	no	self-respect	if	she	rejected	men	who
treated	 her	 so	 well	 like	 he	 did.	 And	 in	 a	 growing	 irony,	 feeling	 entitled	 due	 to
how	 “nice”	 he	 had	 been	 for	 years,	 he	 felt	 as	 though	 he	 deserved	 to	 treat	 her
worse	and	objectify	her,	to	the	point	where	one	night	he	physically	tried	to	force
her	to	kiss	him.

Needless	to	say,	the	friendship	was	over,	as	she	refused	to	ever	see	him	again.

The	 Friend	 Zone	 is	 the	 biggest	 possible	 time	 sink	 because	 most	 men	 who	 are
stuck	 in	 it	 entertain	 fantasies	 that	 they’re	 simply	 waiting	 for	 the	 inevitable	 to
occur.	 It	 plays	 into	 their	 fantasies	 of	 romance	 and	 destiny.	 Their	 perspective	 is
that	they	are	the	perfect	man	for	her	and	one	day	when	she	wakes	up	and	realizes
how	foolish	 she	is,	 she’ll	realize	that	the	love	of	her	life	had	been	sitting	right
there	by	her	side	all	along.

This	never	happens.	Ever.	It’s	an	incredibly	arrogant	and	manipulative	mindset
to	adopt.	It’s	no	wonder	women	see	it	as	so	unattractive.

If	you	are	in	this	situation	now,	you	need	to	get	it	out	of	your	head	and	move	on.
Immediately.	 Typically,	 if	 men	 have	 been	 friends	 with	 a	 woman	 for	 even	 a
month	 or	 two	 without	 ever	 explicitly	 indicating	 their	 sexual	 interest	 in	 her,	 it’s
likely	too	late.

You	 must	 indicate	 some	 sort	 of	 sexual	 interest	 early	 on.	 Otherwise,	 the	 longer
you	wait,	the	harder	it	gets	and	the	more	likely	she	will	become	Unreceptive	to
you.	Again,	ask	yourself	what	waiting	four	years	to	state	your	interest	in	a	girl
sub-communicates	to	her.	It	sub-communicates,	“I	am	so	much	more	invested	in
you	than	in	myself	that	I	spent	four	years	working	up	the	nerve	to	show	you	my
interest.”	It’s	extremely	unattractive.	And	chances	are,	she’s	knows!	She	always
knew!	Which	just	makes	it	worse.

The	second	time	sink	that	men	often	get	sucked	into	is	a	woman	that	is	happily
in	 a	 relationship.	 Unlike	 the	 Friend	 Zone	 where	 men	 will	 often	 waste	 away
months	or	years,	a	woman	in	a	relationship	will	usually	only	waste	a	few	weeks,
maybe	a	few	months	at	the	most.	But	still,	a	time	sink	is	a	time	sink.

A	lot	of	men	get	hung	up	on	women	who	are	already	taken,	and	rather	than	cut
their	losses	and	move	on,	they	harbor	some	fantasy	that	any	woman	will	cheat
on	her	boyfriend/husband	given	the	right	circumstance.	This	isn’t	true.	And	even
in	the	cases	that	it	is	true,	it’s	also	not	worth	the	time	or	effort.

Waiting	 around	 for	 a	 woman	 in	 a	 relationship	 is	 simply	 not	 worth	 it.	 Period.
Trying	to	sabotage	a	woman’s	relationship	so	you	can	swoop	in	and	“steal”	her
is	not	only	ineffectual	but	morally	fucked	up.	It’s	neediness	and	narcissism	to	an
extreme	degree.

What	a	lot	of	men	don’t	understand	though	is	that	oftentimes,	married	or	taken
women	will	still	flirt	with	other	men	for	no	other	reason	than	they	think	it’s	fun
and	they	like	the	attention.	To	some	women,	flirting	is	like	a	hobby	and	they	see
it	 as	 harmless	 fun.	 If	 a	 woman	 is	 married	 or	 has	 a	 boyfriend	 and	 seems	 pretty
happy	 in	 general	 and	 is	 flirting	 with	 me,	 then	 I	 don’t	 take	 the	 flirting	 too
seriously.

Men	also	struggle	a	lot	with	the	rejection,	“I	have	a	boyfriend.”	Some	men	seem
to	get	obsessed	about	whether	this	is	actually	true	or	she’s	just	saying	it	to	reject
him.

Once	again,	it’s	not	about	whether	her	statement	is	factual	or	not.	It’s	about	her

intention.	The	intention	is,	“I’m	not	interested.”

Take	 that	 at	 face	 value	 and	 move	 on.	 Even	 if	 she	 doesn’t	 have	 a	 boyfriend,
there’s	no	point	in	trying	to	win	over	a	girl	who	is	willing	to	lie	about	something
like	 that	 to	 you.	 And	 if	 she	 does	 have	 a	 boyfriend,	 then	 she’s	 probably	 happy
with	him,	otherwise,	she	wouldn’t	have	brought	it	up.

And	that’s	really	the	crux	of	the	matter:	women	who	have	boyfriends/husbands
who	 are	 willing	 to	 cheat	 on	 them,	 don’t	 bring	 up	 their	 boyfriends/husbands...
almost	 ever.	 Typically,	 you’ll	 hear	 about	 them	 either	 immediately	 before	 or
immediately	after	you	hook	up	with	them.	If	they	tell	you	about	them	right	when
you	meet	them,	then	they’re	not	interested.	If	they	tell	you	about	their	boyfriend
while	they’re	making	out	with	you	in	the	cab	back	to	your	apartment,	then	she’s
probably	interested.	But	you	don’t	need	me	to	tell	you	that.

So	your	mission	with	Unreceptive	women	is	to	spot	them	as	quickly	as	possible,
and	then	politely	move	on.	Rejection,	in	this	case,	is	often	your	friend,	as	we’ll
see	later.

It’s	not	until	you	find	a	woman	who	is	Neutral	or	better	that	things	begin	to	get
interesting.

The	 goal	 with	 Neutral	 Women	 is	 to	 get	 them	 to	 stop	 being	 Neutral	 as	 soon	 as
possible.	As	we	mentioned	earlier,	women	who	are	Neutral	and	who	stay	Neutral
tend	 to	 eventually	 end	 up	 Unreceptive.	 You	 do	 this	 by	 expressing	 your
vulnerability	and	your	identity	to	them	freely.

When	 you	 express	 your	 truth	 to	 women,	 you	 will	 polarize	 them	 —	 they	 will
either	 become	 Receptive	 to	 you	 or	 they	 will	 make	 themselves	 Unreceptive.
When	 you	 express	 your	 truth,	 if	 you	 express	 more	 investment	 than	 them,	 then
they	will	be	not	be	attracted	to	you	and	will	therefore	be	Unreceptive.	Also,	if
you	express	your	truth	and	there	is	a	high	amount	of	friction	between	 you	and
her	that	cannot	be	overcome,	then	she	will	become	Unreceptive

If	 you	 express	 your	 truth	 and	 demonstrate	 not	 only	 that	 you’re	 non-needy	 but
also	 frictionless	 for	 her	 (similar	 interests,	 values,	 life	 situation,	 etc.),	 then	 she
will	become	very	Receptive.	And	when	I	say	very	Receptive,	I	mean	very.

A	big	misconception	men	have	is	that	they	think	they	need	to	behave	in	a	way
that	makes	every	single	woman	like	them	–	as	if	women	were	all	the	same.	This

is	counterproductive	because	by	altering	your	behavior	to	fit	whatever	she	wants,
it	 means	 you	 are	 not	 being	 vulnerable	 and,	 therefore,	 you	 are	 being	 needy	 and
unattractive.

Other	men	often	stick	to	plain	jokes	and	safe	topics	of	conversation	that	end	up
not	polarizing	at	all	for	fear	of	being	rejected.	This	is	also	a	form	of	hiding	one’s
truth,	not	showing	vulnerability,	being	over-invested	and	therefore	not	attractive.

This	 is	 the	 plight	 of	 the	 highly	 needy	 “Nice	 Guy.”	 He’s	 afraid	 of	 eliciting	 an
emotional	 response	 in	 anybody,	 especially	 women	 (and	 especially	 himself);
therefore,	 he’ll	 play	 it	 safe	 and	 elicit	 Neutral	 reactions	 from	 woman	 after
woman.	And	when	women	are	Neutral	for	too	long	without	being	polarized,	then
they	will	make	themselves	Unreceptive.

If	 there	 is	 one	 thing	 that	 narcissistic	 men	 accomplish	 well,	 it’s	 that	 they	 will
polarize	women	quickly.	Women	will	know	more	or	less	immediately	if	they’re
interested	 in	 a	 narcissistic	 guy	 or	 not	 because	 he	 will	 be	 so	 overbearing	 and
imposing	she’ll	have	no	choice	other	than	to	feel	something	for	him.

The	 problem	 with	 the	 narcissistic	 man	 is	 that	 the	 few	 women	 who	 become
Receptive	to	him	are	not	the	type	of	women	who	are	pleasant	to	be	around	(as
they’re	highly	needy	themselves).

As	 you	 can	 see,	 Neutral	 women	 are	 where	 so-called	 “game”	 comes	 into	 play.
Having	good	game	means	you	can	take	a	woman	who	is	Neutral	and	incite	her	to
become	 Receptive	 to	 you	 quickly.	 You	 do	 this	 by	 making	 yourself	 vulnerable,
sharing	yourself	unabashedly,	and	polarizing	her	one	way	or	the	other	and	being
comfortable	with	either	result.

For	instance,	I	recently	met	a	beautiful	woman	in	a	nightclub.	She	danced	with
me	 but	 ignored	 my	 attempts	 to	 get	 closer	 to	 her.	 She	 seemed	 content	 to	 dance
with	me	but	was	not	investing	any	effort	in	the	interaction	beyond	that.	Sensing
that	 I	 could	 easily	 get	 stuck	 dancing	 with	 her	 all	 night	 without	 actually
polarizing	her,	I	asked	that	we	go	get	a	drink.	I	told	her	I'd	like	to	get	to	know
her	a	bit	better	and	talk.	She	obliged.

At	the	bar,	the	first	question	out	of	my	mouth	is	one	of	my	favorites	for	Neutral
situations:	"What's	your	favorite	thing	in	the	world?"

This	question	will	tell	me	two	things:	how	passionate	and	self-aware	she	is	about

her	own	life,	and	secondly	if	we	have	anything	in	common.	Women	who	are	not
passionate	or	self-aware	I	drop	very	quickly	and	go	meet	someone	else.	Women
who	share	interests	with	me	give	me	an	opportunity	to	polarize	them	quickly	to
being	Receptive.

For	instance,	if	a	woman	answers	"Jesus,"	then	I	know	I'm	heading	straight	for
Unreceptive	right	then	and	there.	Not	that	I	hate	Jesus	or	anything,	but	let’s	just
say	there’s	a	conflict	of	interests.	This	polarization	is	a	good	thing,	though,	even
though	it	ends	up	with	me	not	getting	the	girl	in	the	end.	We're	both	better	off
not	being	together.	And	by	me	eliciting	her	religiosity	early	on,	we	find	that	out
sooner	rather	than	later.

In	 this	 particular	 example	 at	 the	 nightclub,	 the	 woman	 answered	 traveling	 and
experiencing	new	cultures.	Bingo.	I	love	to	travel.	I've	been	to	over	40	countries.
I	 tell	 her	 this.	 Sure	 enough,	 within	 30	 minutes,	 we	 were	 sitting	 alone	 together,
enrapt	in	a	conversation	about	grammar	and	the	Russian	language.

Do	Russian	grammar	lessons	strike	you	as	an	effective	pick	up	tactic?	Probably
not.	But	I	dig	it.	And	so	did	she.	And	she	eventually	became	my	girlfriend.	My
success	was	about	expressing	my	identity,	forcing	her	to	make	a	decision	about
me	and	letting	the	chips	fall	where	they	may.

Finally,	we	have	the	Receptive	women.	Finding	these	are	the	best	because	they
are	 the	 most	 rewarding	 interactions	 while	 requiring	 the	 least	 amount	 of	 effort.
When	you	meet	a	Receptive	woman,	the	goal	is	simple.	You	escalate.	You	make
a	move.	You	move	things	forward	—	assuming	you	want	to,	of	course.

Receptive	women	who	were	originally	Neutral,	if	you	do	not	make	a	move	and
become	physical	with	them	quickly	enough,	they	will	often	drift	back	to	Neutral
and	 then	 to	 Unreceptive	 permanently.	 But	 I’ve	 found	 that	 women	 who	 are
Receptive	to	you	to	begin	with	will	usually	stay	Receptive	almost	indefinitely.	I
think	these	are	the	only	rare	occasions	when	you	can	actually	pry	yourself	out	of
the	Friend	Zone	—	these	rare	circumstances	where	she	was	always	Receptive	to
you,	 but	 for	 whatever	 reason,	 you	 two	 weren’t	 able	 to	 be	 together	 (you	 had	 a
girlfriend,	she	moved	away	for	three	years,	etc.).

The	percentage	of	women	who	are	Receptive	to	you	will	increase	proportionally
to	the	quality	of	your	lifestyle,	your	social	status,	and	your	looks.	The	percentage
of	 women	 that	 you’re	 able	 to	 move	 from	 Neutral	 to	 Receptive	 will	 be

proportional	 to	 how	 good	 your	 “game”	 is,	 or	 how	 well	 you’re	 able	 to
communicate	and	express	yourself	with	women.	And	your	ability	to	sort	through
each	type	of	women	and	meet	as	many	as	possible	will	be	determined	by	how
fearless	and	bold	you	are	when	it	comes	to	meeting	women.

(That	last	paragraph	was	important	and	the	basis	for	the	rest	of	this	book,	so	you
may	want	to	read	it	again	and	make	sure	you	understand	it.)

While	 most	 pick	 up	 advice	 obsesses	 over	 the	 avoidance	 of	 rejection,	 rejection
plays	an	integral	part	in	my	strategy.	It’s	unavoidable,	so	I	figure	we	may	as	well
develop	a	strategy	that	uses	it	to	help	us.	Rejection	exists	for	a	reason.	If	you	are
a	professor	at	a	prestigious	university,	then	you’re	probably	not	going	to	enjoy
your	time	with	a	high	school	dropout	with	an	alcohol	problem.	Just	because	she
has	a	nice	ass	doesn’t	mean	you	want	to	be	with	her.

Polarizing	women	into	rejecting	us	—	and	when	I	say	us,	I	mean	the	real	us,	the
vulnerable	and	unabashed	us	—	does	us	a	favor	by	sorting	out	which	women	are
going	to	make	us	happy.

Men	 often	 want	 to	 have	 it	 both	 ways	 —	 they	 want	 to	 be	 able	 to	 avoid	 painful
rejections,	avoid	saying	something	stupid,	avoid	embarrassing	themselves,	while
at	 the	 same	 time	 being	 this	 attractive,	 amazing	 guy	 who	 women	 fall	 to	 their
knees	for.

You	can’t	have	it	both	ways.

The	two	go	together.	You	cannot	be	an	attractive	and	life-changing	presence	to
some	 women	 without	 being	 a	 joke	 or	 an	 embarrassment	 to	 others.	 You	 simply
can’t.	 You	 have	 to	 be	 controversial.	 You	 have	 to	 polarize.	 It’s	 the	 name	 of	 the
game.	 And	 getting	 good	 at	 the	 game	 is	 learning	 to	 open	 yourself	 up	 enough
emotionally,	 learning	 to	 express	 your	 honest	 self	 enough	 and	 be	 comfortable
enough	with	your	vulnerability	to	take	those	embarrassing	moments	along	with
the	moments	of	passion.	A	willingness	to	polarize	is	not	easy.	But	it’s	necessary.
It’s	why	you’re	here	right	now.

Polarizing	to	Attract

Our	 primary	 strategy	 with	 women	 is	 polarization.	 The	 idea	 is	 that	 the	 more
forthright	 you	 are	 about	 who	 you	 are,	 how	 you	 feel,	 and	 what	 you	 think,	 the

more	this	is	going	to	weed	out	Unreceptive	Women	from	the	Receptive	women,
as	 well	 as	 push	 Neutral	 women	 to	 get	 off	 the	 fence	 and	 decide	 how	 they	 feel
about	you.

The	 amazing	 thing	 about	 polarization	 is	 that	 the	 simple	 act	 of	 doing	 it
demonstrates	 non-neediness	 and	 will	 then	 inspire	 more	 Neutral	 women	 to
become	Receptive	than	other	strategies	or	tactics.

Like	 I	 mentioned	 earlier,	 the	 most	 common	 strategy	 by	 men	 who	 are
inexperienced	 with	 women	 is	 “to	 be	 liked	 by	 all,	 hated	 by	 none.”	 But	 when	 it
comes	to	being	intimate	and	attracting	women,	this	is	a	horrible	strategy.	Being
hated	by	nobody	usually	means	you’re	not	loved	by	anybody	either.

The	 men	 who	 employ	 this	 strategy	 employ	 it	 because	 they’re	 trying	 to	 avoid
confrontation	 and	 controversy.	 Many	 of	 these	 men	 have	 been	 avoiding
confrontation	 and	 controversy	 their	 entire	 lives.	 It’s	 part	 of	 their	 fear	 of
vulnerability.

The	fact	is	that	sexuality,	attraction,	and	relationships	are,	by	their	very	nature,
confrontational	and	controversial.	You	have	to	either	make	the	decision	to	accept
being	 controversial	 and	 confrontational	 or	 you	 need	 to	 accept	 that	 you	 will	 go
through	life	with	everyone	being	Neutral	towards	you.

Polarization	 is	 what	 occurs	 when	 you	 express	 your	 truth	 and	 make	 yourself
vulnerable.	 When	 you	 tell	 a	 woman	 she	 is	 beautiful,	 you	 are	 polarizing	 her.
When	 you	 tease	 her	 about	 her	 earrings	 and	 put	 your	 arm	 around	 her,	 you’re
polarizing	 her.	 When	 you	 wear	 a	 custom-made	 suit	 when	 you	 go	 out,	 you	 are
polarizing	women.	When	you	tell	a	woman	who’s	late	to	a	date	to	never	be	late
again,	you	are	polarizing	her.	When	you	smile	and	tell	her	how	beautiful	she	is,
you’re	polarizing	her.	When	you	take	her	hand	in	yours	and	lead	her	somewhere,
you	are	polarizing	her.

Everything	that	is	attractive	is	polarizing.

These	 are	 never	 wrong	 moves,	 assuming	 that	 they	 are	 honest	 expressions	 of
yourself	and	you	are	showing	your	vulnerability.

A	man	who	is	highly	invested	is	going	to	alter	his	behaviors	based	on	the	woman
he’s	talking	to.	He’s	going	to	be	afraid	to	tell	her	that	he	doesn’t	accept	her	being
late.	He’s	going	to	be	afraid	to	wear	that	suit	out.	He’s	going	to	be	timid	when	he

wants	 to	 put	 his	 arm	 around	 her.	 He’s	 going	 to	 be	 unable	 to	 make	 himself
vulnerable,	express	his	truth,	and	will	therefore	not	polarize	her.

A	man	who	is	uninhibited	about	expressing	his	emotions	and	what	he	wants	will
demonstrate	non-neediness,	thereby	attracting	a	woman	and	immediately	forcing
her	to	decide	whether	she’s	Receptive	or	Unreceptive.	And	chances	are,	unless
there’s	a	lot	of	friction	present,	she	will	become	Receptive.	You’d	be	surprised
how	many	women	will	respond	with	attraction	to	nothing	other	than	a	man	who
is	bold	and	willing	to	stick	his	neck	out.

A	 lot	 of	 men	 assume	 that	 this	 means	 you	 are	 inviting	 a	 mountain	 of	 rejection
onto	you.	The	surprising	thing	is	this	is	rarely	the	case.	Yes,	you	will	get	rejected
when	 you	 polarize	 women.	 And	 yes,	 every	 once	 in	 a	 while	 it	 will	 be	 a	 harsh
rejection.

But	 surprisingly,	 a	lot	 of	 women	 will	 react	 warmly	 to	 these	 advances,	 even	 if
they’re	not	interested	and	reject	you.	They	respect	a	man	who	is	bold	and	honest.
I’ve	had	tons	occasions	where	I	approached	women	boldly	and	honestly,	stating
directly	that	they	were	beautiful	and	I	wanted	to	meet	them,	and	despite	rejecting
me,	they	were	so	impressed	by	my	boldness	and	confidence	that	they	promptly
introduced	me	to	a	friend	of	theirs	who	was	available.

I’ve	 often	 been	 thanked	 by	 the	 women	 who	 I’ve	 unsuccessfully	 hit	 on,	 not
because	 I	 did	 it,	 but	 for	 the	 way	 I	 did	 it.	 And	 even	 when	 things	 go	 nowhere,
women	at	least	respect	me	and	the	fact	that	I	bluntly	state	what	I	feel.

Most	 of	 the	 harsh	 rejections	 I’ve	 had	 in	 my	 life	 came	 from	 when	 I	 was
performing,	 seeking	 validation,	 when	 I	 was	 over-invested	 and	 needy	 and
overcompensating.	 When	 I	 pursue	 women	 in	 a	 vulnerable	 way,	 almost	 every
woman	at	the	very	least	will	respect	my	advances,	even	if	she’s	not	interested.

In	my	experience,	the	more	polarizing	a	man	is,	the	more	they	are	flooded	with
opportunities	with	women.	This	is	true	for	every	man	I	know	who	is	incredibly
successful	with	meeting	and	dating	women.

The	biggest	mental	hurdle	for	many	men	is	the	ability	to	handle	rejection.	A	lot
of	 men	 have	 had	 it	 ingrained	 into	 them	 all	 of	 their	 lives	 —	 and	 even	 by	 other
dating	advice	—	that	rejection	is	terrible	and	should	be	avoided	at	all	costs.	They
buy	 into	 some	 myth	 that	 there	 are	 magical	 lady’s	 men	 out	 there	 that	 don’t	 get
rejected,	ever.

And	as	we’ll	see,	this	is	not	true.

Chapter	5:
Rejection	and	Success

Business	guru	Dan	Kennedy	once	said,	“Your	ability	to	deal	with	the	failure	will
determine	how	much	you	get	to	deal	with	success.”

My	harshest	rejection	ever	was	in	Austin,	Texas,	probably	winter	of	2007.	I	was
out	 with	 my	 best	 friend	 late	 on	 a	 Friday	 night.	 I	 see	 two	 cute	 girls	 dancing	 by
themselves.	I	approach.	I	lightly	touch	one	on	the	shoulder	and	begin	to	speak.

She	spins	around,	“GET	THE	FUCK	AWAY	FROM	ME!	DON’T	YOU	EVER
FUCKING	TOUCH	ME!”

“Whoa,	 chill	 out,	 I	 didn’t	 do	 anything!”	 I	 try	 to	 blurt	 out	 between	 her	 shrieks.
I’m	not	heard.	She	shoves	me	backward	while	screaming	at	me.	I	push	her	arms
back	to	protect	myself.

The	 slap	 comes	 hard	 and	 fast.	 Totally	 uncalled	 for.	 “GET	 THE	 FUCK	 AWAY
FROM	ME!	DON’T	YOU	EVER	FUCKING	TOUCH	ME	AGAIN!”

Before	I	know	it	bouncers	are	removing	me	from	the	bar.

“I	didn’t	even	do	anything,	I	don’t	even	know	her,”	I	say.

“Yeah,	 whatever	 buddy,”	 the	 bouncer	 says.	 I	 get	 outside	 and	 my	 friend	 comes
out	to	meet	me.	“Dude,	what	fucked	up	thing	did	you	say	now?”

“I	didn’t	say	anything.”	He	looks	at	me	skeptically.	“No,	seriously,	I	didn’t	say
anything.”

“Yeah,	whatever.”

Another	night,	another	bar.	This	was	probably	sometime	in	2006.	I’m	talking	to
a	 super	 cute	 blonde.	 College	 girl.	 Sorority.	 Ditsy	 as	 hell	 and	 a	 true	 pain	 to
interact	with.	You	know	those	people	who	interrupt	you	constantly	and	redirect
every	possible	topic	of	conversation	back	to	some	inane	story	about	themselves?
She	was	one	of	those.	It	was	like	being	socially	waterboarded.

But	she	was	hot.	And	I	was	young	and	needy	and	crazy	horny	and	honestly	had
nothing	better	to	do.	So	I	talked	to	her,	painfully	and	begrudgingly.

Somewhere	in	between	trying	to	decide	whether	to	drown	myself	in	alcohol,	to
drown	her	in	alcohol,	to	stab	myself	in	the	face	with	a	broken	beer	bottle	or	to
stab	her	…	she	let	loose	this	little	gem:

“By	the	way,	thanks	for	not	being	ugly.”

I	 disregarded	 the	 compliment	 and	 honed	 in	 on	 what	 was	 so	 shallow,	 so
immature,	and	I	just	couldn’t	stand	by	idly	any	longer.

“Excuse	me?”	I	asked.
“I	said,	thanks	for	not	being	ugly.”

I	imagine	my	mouth	fell	open	here.	But	of	course,	she	missed	my	incredulity	and
continued	on	with	her	monolog	(she	was	good	at	monolog).

“See,	no	offense,	but	talking	to	guys	in	bars	is	so	boring.	And	tonight,	nothing
but	 these	 hideously	 ugly	 guys	 have	 been	 talking	 to	 me	 and	 buying	 me	 drinks.
But	at	least	you’re	not	ugly.”

At	least?

She	continues:	“To	be	honest,	I	can’t	stand	ugly	people.	Like,	it	seriously	hurts
my	 soul	to	 look	 at	ugly	 people.	Like,	I	 honestly	feel	 physical	 pain	 if	I	have	to
look	at	an	ugly	person.”

I	couldn’t	hold	back	anymore,	“You	must	not	own	any	mirrors	then.”

Her	face:	disbelief,	horror,	then	anger	—	in	that	order,	half	a	second	max	—	then
her	fruity	drink	came	flying	onto	my	face,	followed	by	a	dainty	slap.

“Asshole!”

She	stormed	back	to	her	friends.

When	I	first	started	going	out	and	trying	to	meet	girls,	I	used	to	be	horrified	at
the	 thought	 of	 something	 like	 the	 above	 stories	 happening	 to	 me.	 The	 idea	 of
getting	slapped,	or	a	drink	thrown	on	me,	or	getting	thrown	out	of	a	bar,	these

were	all	nightmares	that	would	probably	have	visibly	shaken	me	at	the	thought
of	them	happening.	Maybe	you	feel	the	same	way	right	now.

But	both	of	these	memories	are	still	bright	in	my	mind,	as	they’re	some	of	the
most	important	learning	experiences	I	had	with	women	—	even	more	important
than	many	of	my	successes.

Believe	it	or	not,	being	slapped	by	these	women	taught	me	a	lot	about	attraction,
as	much	as	anything	else	that	I’ve	experienced.	For	starters,	being	slapped	by	a
woman	 is	 not	 the	 end	 of	 the	 world,	 or	 even	 of	 the	 interaction.	 It’s	 simply	 an
emotional	response.	And	as	a	highly	emotional	response,	I’ll	always	take	being
slapped	 over	 indifference	 or	 boredom	 any	 day.	 It’s	 polarizing.	 And	 polarizing
women	is	more	important	than	being	pleasant	to	them.

Being	slapped	also	taught	me	that	you	can’t	always	control	how	people	react	to
you.	 Some	 people	 are	 completely	 out	 of	 their	 minds	 or	 they	 behave	 very
inappropriately.	You	can’t	help	this.	You	cannot	control	what	happens	in	every
interaction.	The	sooner	you	accept	this,	the	better	off	you	will	be.

Sometimes	 you’ll	 deserve	 being	 rejected.	 Sometimes	 you	 won’t.	 I	 don’t	 regret
what	I	said	to	the	sorority	girl,	though	in	hindsight,	I	probably	didn’t	need	to	be
rude	to	her	—	if	that	happened	today,	I’d	just	excuse	myself	and	walk	away.

As	with	any	type	of	failure,	it’s	not	until	you’ve	been	rejected	a	certain	amount
that	 you	 realize	 how	 insignificant	 it	 actually	 is,	 how	 you	 spent	 so	 much	 time
worrying	about	nothing,	and	how	you’re	free	to	act	however	you	choose.

The	 reason	 men	 fear	 rejection	 is	 because	 they’re	 operating	 on	 other	 peoples’
truths,	not	their	own.	In	fact,	men	who	fear	rejection	tend	to	be	oblivious	to	their
own	 truth	 because	 if	 they	 were	 aware	 of	 their	 own	 desires,	 needs	 and	 values,
what	would	they	have	to	be	afraid	of?	Why	would	they	ever	hesitate	to	expose
their	vulnerability	to	others?

Most	 men	 with	 weak	 grasps	 of	 their	 own	 truth	 fantasize	 about	 the	 ability	 to
never	 be	 rejected,	 ever.	 Not	 only	 is	 this	 a	 manifestation	 of	 their	 neediness,	 but
it’s	unrealistic.	Being	rejected	saves	me	so	much	time	and	effort.	If	I	had	to	go
on	a	date	with	every	single	girl	I	found	even	mildly	attractive,	I’d	probably	lose
my	mind.

It’s	Usually	Not	About	You

As	soon	as	you	realize	that	95%	of	this	attracting	women	stuff	has	nothing	to	do
with	 you,	 is	 the	 moment	 you	 become	 free	 to	 pursue	 what	 you	 want	 without
hesitation	or	fear.

When	you	get	out	there	and	start	meeting	a	lot	of	women,	you’ll	begin	to	notice
that	there’s	a	lot	to	be	said	about	“the	right	person	at	the	wrong	time.”	I	can’t	tell
you	how	many	times	I’ve	met	an	amazing	woman,	but	some	circumstance	was
standing	in	the	way.	It	happens	all	the	time.	It	may	be	that	she’s	on	vacation	and
flying	2,000	miles	home	tomorrow.	Or	that	she	just	got	back	together	with	her
long-term	 boyfriend	 and	 doesn’t	 want	 to	 screw	 it	 up.	 Or	 that	 her	 dog	 just	 died
and	she	really	doesn’t	feel	like	talking	tonight.	Or	that	her	ex-boyfriend	has	been
calling	her	and	harassing	her	and	she	just	wants	to	be	left	alone.	Or	that	the	last
guy	who	she	went	on	a	date	with	grabbed	her	ass	and	treated	her	like	shit	and	he
had	the	same	name	as	you.

There	are	a	million	extraneous	circumstances	completely	outside	of	your	control
and	 at	 any	 given	 time,	 a	 large	 chunk	 of	 the	 women	 you	 meet	 and	 talk	 to	 are
going	 to	 be	 experiencing	 one	 of	 them.	 The	 best	 you	 can	 do	 is	 to	 let	 it	 go	 and
remember:	it’s	not	about	you.

This	 is	 why	 we	 pursue	 women	 based	 on	 our	 truth.	 This	 is	 why	 we	 polarize
women	as	soon	as	possible.	This	is	why	we	approach	women	looking	to	see	if
she	fits	our	values	and	needs	and	not	the	other	way	around.

Most	 men,	 when	 they	 meet	 women,	 are	 thinking	 something	 like,	 “I	 hope	 she
likes	me,”	or	“I	hope	she	doesn’t	embarrass	me	or	reject	me.”	It’s	all	about	them.
And	 therefore,	 when	 things	 don’t	 go	 anywhere,	 the	 men	 take	 it	 personally	 —
they	get	upset	or	angry	or	butt-hurt	that	this	random	stranger	with	breasts	isn’t
laughing	at	their	lame	joke	right	now.

Instead	 of	 thinking,	 “I	 wonder	 if	 she’ll	 like	 me,”	 think,	 “I	 wonder	 what	 she’s
like?”

Instead	of	thinking,	“I	hope	she	doesn’t	reject	me,”	think,	“I	hope	I'll	find	out	if
she’s	right	for	me.”

The	beauty	is	that	whether	she	falls	in	love	with	you	on	the	spot	or	she	throws	a
drink	 in	 your	 face…	 you’ve	 succeeded.	 You’ve	 found	 out	 the	 truth.	 Your

curiosity	 is	 fulfilled	 and	 you	 can	 now	 decide	 whether	 you	 should	 move	 on	 or
not.

I	see	every	rejection	simply	as	some	form	of	incompatibility.	Whether	she	thinks
I’m	a	total	creep,	or	she’s	crazy	about	me	but	we	live	on	different	continents,	or
she’s	 in	 a	 horrible	 mood	 when	 I	 ask	 her	 out,	 or	 she	 thinks	 I’m	 cute	 but	 has
different	values	and	interests	than	me	—	whatever	the	reason,	if	a	woman	ever
rejects	 me,	 it’s	 because	 she’s	 not	 compatible	 with	 me.	 It	 may	 be	 a	 permanent
incompatibility.	It	may	be	a	temporary	incompatibility.	But	the	point	is	that	if	she
liked	me	enough,	she’d	be	willing	to	work	at	making	it	happen	with	me.	And	if
she	 doesn’t,	 then	 that	 just	 means	 it’s	 wrong	 person	 —	 or	 right	 person,	 wrong
time.	And	that’s	fine.

Remember,	it’s	“Fuck	Yes!”	or	no.	And	if	I’m	not	getting	a	“Fuck	Yes!”	then	I’d
much	rather	have	a	no	than	a	“Meh,	OK.”

Redefining	Success

The	 concept	 of	 “success”	 in	 modern	 dating	 advice	 is	 often	 skewed.	 It’s
influenced	 on	 the	 one	 side	 from	 traditional	 roles	 and	 rules	 —	 get	 a	 nice
girlfriend,	get	married,	etc.	—	and	on	the	other	side	by	unrealistic	expectations
and	social	pressures	by	other	men	—	to	be	“the	man,”	you	have	to	bed	dozens	of
women,	 that	 you	 should	 never	 be	 rejected,	 you	 should	 be	 banging	 models	 and
“10’s,”	etc.	Men	put	a	lot	of	pressure	on	one	another	and	shame	one	another	for
being	 rejected	 and	 this	 develops	 an	 unhealthy	 culture	 of	 masculinity	 based
around	neediness	rather	than	genuine	self-expression.

Choosing	how	we	define	success	with	women	is	vitally	important.	If	you	choose
the	wrong	way	to	define	success	for	yourself,	then	the	months	or	years	of	effort
you	put	into	achieving	that	goal	will	go	to	waste.

For	instance,	men	who	define	success	for	themselves	as	how	many	women	they
can	 have	 sex	 with	 will	 waste	 away	 time	 pursuing	 and	 manipulating	 women
whom	they	don’t	necessarily	enjoy	or	aren’t	even	that	attracted	to	in	the	name	of
achieving	the	“success”	which	they’ve	defined	for	themselves.

This	isn’t	a	shooting	range	we’re	on	here.	We’re	talking	about	the	health	of	our
emotional	 lives.	 Women	 and	 our	 relationships	 are	 one	 and	 the	 same	 with	 our
emotional	health,	and	so	the	way	in	which	we	perceive	women	and	relationships

is	going	to	be	reflected	in	our	emotional	well-being.

If	you	choose	to	believe	“success”	with	women	is	determined	by	which	woman
chooses	you	or	how	much	money	you	can	provide	—	well,	then	there’s	a	good
chance	you’re	going	to	be	quite	lonely	followed	by	ending	up	with	the	nearest
woman	capable	of	tolerating	you	for	a	lifetime.

If	 you	 choose	 to	 believe	 “success”	 with	 women	 is	 a	 lay	 count	 or	 some	 other
statistical	 data	 point,	 then	 your	 love	 life	 will	 become	 just	 as	 objectified	 as	 the
women	you	meet,	and	although	you’ll	have	the	quantity	of	interactions	to	back
you	up	on	paper,	all	emotional	quality	will	be	lost,	along	with	your	happiness.

I	 define	 success	 in	 a	 qualitative	 way:	 maximizing	 happiness	 with	 whichever
woman/women	I	prefer	to	be	with.

Success	=	Maximizing	happiness	with	whichever	woman/women	we	prefer

This	may	seem	like	an	obvious	statement,	but	the	implications	are	actually	quite
profound.	 For	 most	 of	 the	 men	 in	 the	 world,	 their	 “success”	 with	 women	 is
defined	by:

Being	married	or	not	being	single.

-	Never	being	rejected.
-	Dating	a	woman	who	is	more	attractive	than	his	friends’	girlfriends.
-	How	many	women	they	can	approach	or	have	a	date	with.
-	Quantity	of	women	rather	than	quality	of	women.
-	If	she	fits	some	stereotype	of	what	“beauty”	is.
-	If	she’s	the	kind	of	woman	you’ve	been	raised	to	think	you	should	date.

When	 we	 define	 success	 as	 finding	 the	 relationship(s)	 that	 will	 maximize	 our
happiness,	 our	 approach	 takes	 a	 completely	 new	 light.	 Instead	 of	 waiting	 and
hoping	 for	 a	 woman	 to	 select	 us,	 instead	 of	 racking	 up	 numbers,	 instead	 of
winning	bragging	rights,	instead	of	avoiding	rejections	—	our	success	is	defined
by	 screening	 through	 as	 many	 women	 as	 possible	 until	 we	 find	 the	 ones	 we
enjoy	and	the	ones	who	enjoy	us.

Suddenly,	 rejection	 goes	 from	 hurting	 our	 success	 rate	 to	 often	 helping	 it.
Having	a	great	date	with	a	woman	who	wants	to	wait	to	have	sex	with	you	can
become	a	far	greater	success	than	that	woman	who	bangs	your	brains	out	an	hour

after	meeting	you.

We	screen	through	these	women	by	polarizing	them.	We	are	polarizing	them	by
sharing	our	truth	with	them	openly	and	freely.	And	when	we	do	this,	women	will
either	become	incredibly	attracted	to	us	or	they	will	reject	us.	Either	way,	we’ll
be	the	happier	for	it.

And	 not	 only	 do	 we	 pursue	 and	 polarize	 the	 women	 we	 believe	 will	 make	 us
happy,	but	we	also	push	the	interaction.	Some	men	become	satisfied	with	how
many	women	they	can	kiss	or	how	many	phone	numbers	they	can	collect.	This	is
not	 success.	 This	 is	 not	 success	 because	 you	 are	 not	 maximizing	 your
relationships	with	these	women.	These	metrics	are	part	of	the	process.	There	is
no	happiness	inherent	in	owning	more	phone	numbers	than	anyone	else.	You’re
chasing	validation,	not	fulfillment.	You	are	not	dating	them,	sleeping	with	them,
becoming	 intimate	 with	 them	 or	 even	 committing	 to	 them.	 Get	 out	 there	 and
expose	yourself.	Open	yourself	up	and	find	what	makes	you	happy.	Yes,	that	will
mean	you’ll	probably	get	hurt.	But	so	what?	The	best	things	in	life	don’t	come
easily.

So	it’s	time	to	get	into	the	nitty-gritty.	So	far	we’ve	spent	most	of	the	book	being
introspective	and	talking	about	our	emotional	lives.	Whether	we	get	any	specific
woman	or	not	depends	on	our	level	of	investment	relative	to	our	investment	in
ourselves.	This	is	non-neediness.	We	build	non-neediness	through	vulnerability.
We	practice	vulnerability	by	being	honest.

There	are	three	ways	in	which	we	are	honest.	And	those	three	ways	will	make	up
the	 bulk	 of	 this	 book.	 The	 three	 ways	 are	 1)	 living	 based	 on	 our	 values
(lifestyle);	 2)	 becoming	 comfortable	 with	 our	 intentions	 (boldness);	 and	 3)	 by
expressing	our	sexuality	freely	(communication).

The	first	way	of	expressing	our	truth	involves	developing	a	lifestyle	that	makes
us	 happy.	 The	 second	 way	 of	 expressing	 truth	 is	 by	 being	 courageous	 and
fighting	through	our	fears	and	anxieties.	And	the	third	way	of	expressing	truth	is
by	communicating	well	and	being	uninhibited	in	our	sexuality.

Choosing	to	not	live	a	lifestyle	based	on	our	values	and	interests	is	only	being
dishonest	with	ourselves.	It	reflects	a	higher	investment	in	others	than	in	oneself.
Therefore,	it	is	unattractive.

Not	acting	on	our	desires	and	asserting	ourselves	where	appropriate	is	showing

more	investment	in	others	than	ourselves.	It	is	therefore	unattractive.

And	 not	 communicating	 our	 thoughts,	 feelings,	 and	 desires	 freely	 and	 clearly
also	 demonstrates	 more	 investment	 in	 others	 than	 in	 ourselves.	 This	 is	 also
unattractive.

Lifestyle,	 Courage,	 and	 Communication:	 I	 refer	 to	 these	 as	 the	 Three
Fundamentals.

Chapter	6:
The	Three	Fundamentals

The	Three	Fundamentals	are	the	three	ways	in	which	a	man	can	become	more
vulnerable	 and	 become	 less	 needy.	 Improving	 each	 one	 of	 the	 Three
Fundamentals	 will	 improve	 your	 results,	 sometimes	 drastically.	 Each	 of	 the
Three	 Fundamentals	 can	 be	 worked	 on	 independently,	 but	 as	 we’ll	 see	 later,
improving	one	of	the	three	often	indirectly	benefits	the	other	two	and	vice-versa.

The	Three	Fundamentals	are:

1.	Creating	an	attractive	and	enriching	lifestyle.
2.	 Overcoming	 your	 fears	 and	 anxiety	 around	 socializing,	 intimacy	 and
sexuality.
3.	Mastering	the	expression	of	your	emotions	and	communicating	fluidly.

The	way	to	improve	each	of	these	fundamentals	is	by	drilling	deeper	into	your
vulnerability	 for	 each	 one	 of	 them.	 So	 one	 way	 to	 think	 about	 it	 is	 that	 the
fundamentals	 are	 the	 categories	 in	 which	 you	 can	 improve	 your	 results	 with
women	(and	general	well-being),	and	expressing	your	vulnerability	and	seeking
truth	is	the	process	in	which	you	improve	in	the	categories.

For	 short,	 I	 refer	 to	 the	 Three	 Fundamentals	 as	 Honest	 Living,	 Honest	 Action,
and	Honest	Communication.

For	 instance,	 Honest	 Living,	 or	 creating	 an	 attractive	 lifestyle	 involves	 really
drilling	down	and	understanding	what	you	want	as	a	man	for	your	life	and	then
working	to	make	that	a	reality.	If	you’re	in	a	job	you	hate	with	hobbies	you	hate
and	friends	you	don’t	like,	then	no	matter	what	you	do	or	how	much	money	you
make,	you’re	going	to	have	a	hard	time	meeting	attractive	women	that	you	enjoy
and	 who	 enjoy	 being	 with	 you.	 This	 is	 because	 the	 identity	 you	 have	 adopted
does	not	accurately	reflect	your	emotional	needs	and	desires.	You	are	not	living
your	life	honestly,	which	means	you	are	not	investing	in	yourself,	which	means
you	are	needy	and	unattractive.

If	your	true	passion	is	art	and	you	push	paper	around	at	an	insurance	firm,	then
you’re	not	living	honestly.	You’ve	compromised	your	identity	in	some	way	to	fit

what	 others	 have	 dictated	 it	 should	 be;	 in	 this	 case,	 you’ve	 given	 up	 what
actually	 makes	 you	 happy	 in	 order	 to	 fit	 the	 values	 or	 roles	 of	 other	 people	 in
society	 (having	 a	 stable	 job,	 working	 in	 the	 corporate	 world,	 having	 a	 nice
house/car,	etc.).	This	displays	a	lack	of	vulnerability	and	neediness.

If	those	things	aren’t	actually	important	to	you,	then	you	have	a	responsibility	to
yourself	 to	 change.	 Otherwise,	 you’re	 always	 going	 to	 be	 an	 unattractive	 man.
How	 so?	 Because	 you’re	 living	 40	 hours	 a	 week,	 every	 week,	 investing	 your
identity	in	what	others	want	out	of	you	and	not	what	you	want	of	yourself.	This
is	 like	 baseline	 neediness,	 and	 until	 you	 straighten	 this	 out,	 you	 will	 be	 needy
with	 every	 woman	 you	 meet,	 preventing	 you	 from	 meeting	 the	 truly	 amazing
women	that	you	could	potentially	be	with	one	day.

Honest	Living	correlates	directly	with	the	quality	of	women	that	you	will	attract.
The	 more	 in-tune	 you	 are	 to	 your	 lifestyle,	 the	 more	 you	 take	 care	 of	 your
appearance	and	your	health,	the	higher	the	quality	of	women	you	will	attract	and
the	greater	percentage	of	Receptive	women	you’ll	meet.

Honest	Action	is	overcoming	your	fear	and	anxiety	around	women.	Our	anxiety
is	 another	 form	 in	 which	 we	 highly	 invest	 ourselves	 in	 others’	 perceptions	 and
avoid	our	truth.	Like	a	poor	lifestyle,	it	also	seems	to	be	embedded	in	us	and	it’s
something	that	requires	a	lot	of	thought	and	effort	to	repair	over	a	longer	period
of	time.

I	 call	 it	 Honest	 Action	 because	 it	 is	 honesty	 in	 the	 strictest	 terms.	 If	 you	 see	 a
beautiful	woman	and	have	a	desire	to	meet	her,	to	not	take	action	and	meet	her	is
a	form	of	being	dishonest	with	yourself.	If	you’re	standing	in	a	bar,	and	you	see
a	 woman	 who	 catches	 your	 interest,	 and	 you	 keep	 looking	 at	 her	 all	 night
because	you’re	afraid	to	do	something,	on	a	deep	level,	you’re	being	dishonest
about	 your	 intentions	 and	 sexuality.	 You’re	 being	 overly	 invested	 in	 her	 and
others’	opinions	and	are	unable	to	expose	your	vulnerability.

All	 fear	 around	 your	 sexuality	 is	 a	 result	 of	 feeling	 inferior	 or	 unworthy.	 If
you’re	afraid	to	approach	a	woman,	it’s	because	somewhere	inside	you	are	more
invested	in	her	opinion	of	you	than	you	are	in	your	own	opinion	of	yourself.	If
you’re	afraid	to	ask	a	woman	to	come	home	with	you,	it’s	because	you	are	afraid
of	the	sexual	reality	that	you	want	to	sleep	with	her	—	you’re	more	invested	in
her	not	rejecting	you	than	you	are	in	aligning	yourself	with	your	desires.

Overcoming	 your	 fear	 and	 anxiety	 will	 correlate	 with	 your	 overall	 results	 with
women.	The	reason	being	that	once	a	man	overcomes	his	fear	of	rejection,	he’s
willing	to	more	or	less	pursue	any	woman	he	wants	when	he	wants.	Even	if	he’s
a	deadbeat	(lacks	a	good	lifestyle)	or	even	if	he’s	terrible	at	expressing	himself
(lacks	good	communication	skills),	he	will	eventually	meet	women	who	want	to
date	 him	 and	 sleep	 with	 him	 by	 no	 other	 means	 than	 pure	 numbers.	 If	 he’s
willing	to	approach	500	women	with	no	fear	of	rejection,	eventually	at	least	one
of	them	is	going	to	stick.

Honest	Action	correlates	directly	to	the	quantity	of	women	you	meet	and	attract.

The	third	fundamental	is	Honest	Communication,	or	learning	to	express	yourself
freely	 and	 effectively.	 This	 is	 what	 most	 dating	 advice	 sells	 and	 classifies	 as
“game”	 —	 a	 good	 sense	 of	 humor,	 the	 ability	 to	 connect	 with	 people,	 telling
stories,	 engaging	 people’s	 attention,	 having	 charisma,	 and	 expressing	 your
sexuality	openly.	These	are	all	parts	of	this	fundamental.

I	call	it	Honest	Communication	because	it’s	learning	how	to	communicate	your
true	intentions	and	emotions	to	others	clearly.	Often	we	have	certain	thoughts	or
feelings,	but	we	don’t	know	the	best	way	to	convey	those	thoughts	or	feelings.
This	third	fundamental	focuses	on	how	to	do	that.

Honest	Communication	will	determine	the	efficiency	with	which	you	are	able	to
attract	women	who	are	compatible	to	you.	A	man	who	communicates	poorly	or
is	 unable	to	express	himself	clearly	will	lose	a	lot	 of	romantic	 opportunities	 to
“lost	 in	 translation”	 situations	 —	 misunderstandings,	 vague	 communications,
inaccurate	assumptions,	etc.

Natural	Advantages/Disadvantages

Chances	 are,	 you’re	 already	 pretty	 strong	 in	 one	 or	 more	 of	 the	 Three
Fundamentals	 and	 weak	 or	 mediocre	 at	 one	 or	 more	 of	 them.	 Where	 your
strengths	and	weaknesses	lie	will	determine	not	just	the	quantity	of	your	results
with	women,	but	also	the	types	of	outcomes	you	achieve.

For	 instance,	 a	 man	 with	 an	 amazing	 lifestyle	 but	 poor	 action	 and	 poor
communication	will	be	surrounded	by	beautiful	and	interesting	women	but	never
be	 with	 them.	 Classic	 examples	 of	 this	 are	 rich	 or	 good-looking	 men	 who	 are
still	single	and	frustrated.	They	may	have	money,	connections,	power	and	meet

beautiful	 women	 regularly	 (or	 have	 beautiful	 women	 approach	 them),	 but
they’re	never	able	to	capitalize	on	their	opportunities.

A	man	with	no	fear	or	anxiety	with	women	will	be	able	to	approach	and	ask	out
many	 women,	 but	 his	 effort-to-reward	 ratio	 will	 be	 poor	 and	 the	 quality	 of
women	will	be	worse.	Often	a	lot	of	aspiring	players	fall	into	this	category	—
they	go	out	5-6	nights	per	week,	approach	dozens	of	women,	fail	with	almost	all
of	them,	but	every	once	in	a	while	convince	a	drunk	sloppy	girl	to	come	home
with	them.

A	man	with	great	communication	skills	but	a	lot	of	fear	and	a	poor	lifestyle	will
rarely	 meet	 or	 attract	 beautiful	 women,	 but	 the	 few	 times	 he	 does,	 he	 will
capitalize	on	his	few	opportunities.	Most	so-called	“normal”	guys	are	like	this.
They	rarely	see	opportunities,	but	when	they	come	along,	they	take	them	and	do
well.	The	problem	with	these	men	is	that	they	never	feel	like	they’re	in	control
of	their	love	lives.	They’re	always	waiting	for	that	next	woman	who’s	interested
to	come	around.	And	sometimes	they	end	up	waiting	quite	a	while.

The	 Three	 Fundamentals	 are	 interesting	 in	 that	 they	 explain	 why	 a	 lot	 of	 men
implement	a	lot	 of	 dating	advice	or	self-improvement	and	don’t	 see	any	actual
change	 in	 results.	 If	 your	 weakness	 is	 that	 you	 aren’t	 able	 to	 communicate
coherently	 or	 empathize	 with	 what	 other	 people	 are	 expressing,	 then	 being
encouraged	to	approach	500	new	women	is	going	to	be	an	absolute	disaster.

If	you	are	broke,	live	with	your	parents,	and	have	no	job,	then	being	encouraged
to	spend	all	of	your	time	and	money	out	in	nightclubs	is	only	going	to	get	you	a
bunch	of	meaningless	sex	with	mediocre	drunk	girls	who	have	no	better	options.

If	 you	 are	 scared	 to	 death	 of	 saying	 anything	 to	 a	 woman	 you	 find	 attractive,
then	the	best	conversation	tricks,	teasing	and	flirting	lines,	or	even	openers	are
not	going	to	help	you	at	all.

But	as	I	said	earlier,	the	Three	Fundamentals	are	interdependent	—	they	feed	off
of	one	another.	So	if	your	biggest	problem	is	an	inability	to	communicate	well,
then	meeting	100	new	women	won’t	directly	benefit	you,	but	the	fact	that	you’re
talking	to	100	new	people	will	indirectly	help	your	issue.	In	the	same	way,	being
able	to	communicate	effectively	will	help	guys	with	extreme	levels	of	anxiety	in
their	development	because	the	few	times	they	do	work	up	the	nerve	to	make	a
move	on	women,	they	will	usually	do	it	in	a	smooth	and	socially-attuned	way.

It’s	 important	 to	 cater	 the	 advice	 that	 you	 implement	 to	 your	 specific	 issues.
Hopefully	 reading	 this	 chapter,	 you	 have	 at	 least	 a	 vague	 idea	 of	 where	 your
weaknesses	are.	The	rest	of	this	book	is	dedicated	to	breaking	down	each	of	the
Fundamentals	individually	and	giving	clear	how-to	guides	for	improving	them.
Identifying	and	focusing	on	the	fundamental(s)	you	need	to	work	on	most	will
be	the	quickest	route	to	improving	your	love	life	and	sex	life.	Most	of	you	will
have	one	or	two	main	weaknesses	and	probably	one	natural	strength.	But	some
of	you	may	be	weak	in	all	of	them.	I	guarantee	you,	if	you’re	reading	this,	you
are	not	strong	in	all	of	them.	If	you	think	you	are	and	are	still	reading	this	far,
then	 you’re	 deluding	 yourself	 and	 need	 to	 re-read	 Chapter	 3	 on	 being	 honest
with	yourself.

Two	Types	of	Men

In	my	experience,	almost	all	men	who	struggle	with	relationships	fall	into	one	of
two	categories:	socially	anxious	or	socially	disconnected.

Socially	 anxious	 men	 tend	 to	 have	 the	 third	 fundamental	 down	 very	 well.
They’re	good	at	expressing	themselves	and	are	very	aware	of	social	norms	and
what	others	are	thinking/feeling.	In	fact,	in	a	lot	of	cases,	socially	anxious	men
are	too	aware	of	what	other	people	are	thinking	and	feeling	and,	therefore,	have
a	lot	of	social	anxiety.	They’re	afraid	to	speak	to	new	women.	They	get	nervous
pushing	things	forward.	They’re	scared	to	ask	women	on	dates.

Generally,	 though,	 once	 these	 men	 do	 meet	 a	 woman	 who	 likes	 them,	 they	 do
OK.	They	can	converse	with	her	all	night.	And	if	she	happens	to	be	attracted	to
him,	 he’s	 not	 such	 a	 mess.	 But	 it’s	 the	 actual	 being	 pro-active	 and	 making	 a
move	 that	 scares	 him	 to	 death.	 These	 men	 usually	 spend	 most	 of	 their	 time
focusing	on	overcoming	fear	and	little	time	on	expression.

Socially	 disconnected	 men	 are	 the	 opposite.	 These	 are	 men	 who	 have	 always
been	a	little	bit	“oblivious”	to	what	others	think	and	feel	around	them.	Usually,
they’re	 guys	 who	 have	 always	 kind	 of	 kept	 to	 themselves	 and	 grew	 up	 more
interested	in	their	studies	or	some	nerdy	subject	than	the	people	around	them.

Interestingly,	 men	 who	 are	 socially	 disconnected	 have	 far	 less	 fear	 or	 anxiety
when	it	comes	to	approaching,	pursuing,	or	escalating	with	women.	In	fact,	it’s
because	they’re	so	oblivious	to	social	cues	and	what	others	are	thinking/feeling
that	they	are	so	fearless	around	them.

The	 struggle	 for	 men	 in	 this	 category	 is	 going	 to	 be	 the	 third	 fundamental:
learning	how	to	express	themselves	and	understanding	how	people	think	and	feel
around	them.	These	men	have	little	hesitance	or	fear	for	action,	but	they	tend	to
do	the	wrong	actions	at	the	wrong	times	over	and	over	and	over,	and	they	rarely
understand	why.

The	first	fundamental	(lifestyle)	is	all	over	the	map	and	is	a	work-in-progress	for
everyone.	 The	 better	 your	 lifestyle,	 the	 easier	 everything	 else	 will	 be.	 And
ultimately	 you	 should	 be	 working	 on	 your	 lifestyle	 for	 yourself	 first	 and
foremost	—	the	attractiveness	to	women	is	just	an	enjoyable	side	effect.

But	the	second	and	third	fundamentals	are	intimately	connected	to	one	another.
Anxious	guys	are	anxious	because	they’re	so	socially	attuned	to	others	(perhaps
even	 too	 socially	 in	 tune	 with	 others),	 and	 socially	 disconnected	 guys	 are
fearless	because	they	are	socially	disconnected	from	others.

The	idea	is	to	become	socially	connected	and	fearless	at	the	same	time	and	have
an	awesome	and	attractive	lifestyle.	The	full	package.	The	Three	Fundamentals.

But	whichever	type	you	are,	read	all	three	sections,	as	even	reading	about	areas
in	which	you’re	naturally	strong	will	reinforce	your	positive	habits.	And	you	will
probably	pick	up	a	few	pointers	on	how	to	improve	your	strengths	even	further.

Part	III	is	about	Honest	Living	—	building	an	attractive	and	abundant	lifestyle	so
that	 quality	 women	 who	 are	 most	 compatible	 with	 you	 naturally	 gravitate	 into
your	life.

Part	IV	is	about	Honest	Action	—	overcoming	your	fears	and	anxieties	so	that
you	may	act	on	your	impulses	and	desires	without	hesitation	or	shame.

Part	V	is	about	Honest	Communication	—	training	yourself	to	express	yourself
openly	 and	effectively	in	a	dynamic	and	interesting	way	that	will	keep	women
interested	 in	 you	 and	 help	 you	 make	 that	 transition	 to	 becoming	 physical	 with
them.

Parts	III	and	IV	are	divided	into	two	chapters	each.	The	first	covers	the	concepts
and	ideas	of	that	fundamental	and	the	second	gives	specific,	actionable	advice	on
how	 to	 improve	 each	 fundamental.	 For	 instance,	 in	 Part	 III	 (Honest	 Living),
Chapter	7	covers	the	concept	of	Demographics	and	 how	it	affects	how	women
are	going	to	respond	to	you.	Chapter	8	is	called	“Lifestyle	and	Presentation"	and

describes	how	we	can	use	the	knowledge	of	demographics	to	make	ourselves	as
attractive	as	possible	to	each	woman	we	meet.

Part	 V	 has	 four	 chapters	 to	 cover	 all	 aspects	 of	 communicating	 efficiently
(verbally,	 physically,	 etc.),	 as	 well	 as	 what’s	 socially	 expected	 in	 the	 courtship
process.

And	keep	in	mind	moving	forward	that	the	foundation	behind	all	of	the	advice
given	is	the	idea	that	an	honest	expression	of	yourself	and	your	desires	as	a	man
is	 the	 most	 effective	 way	 to	 demonstrate	 non-neediness	 and	 to	 therefore	 create
lasting	and	genuine	attraction	with	women	who	will	make	you	the	happiest.

If	 at	 any	 point	 along	 the	 first	 six	 chapters	 you	 felt	 like	 something	 didn’t	 make
sense	or	didn’t	“click,”	then	you	may	want	to	flip	back	and	review	it.	If	not,	if
everything	 makes	 sense	 and	 the	 reasoning	 behind	 everything	 I’ve	 said	 so	 far
makes	sense,	then	you’re	ready.	Read	on...

Part	III:	Honest	Living

Chapter	7:
Demographics

Before	 we	 get	 into	 what	 to	 say	 to	 women,	 how	 to	 make	 them	 laugh,	 where	 to
take	them,	how	to	kiss	them;	before	we	even	get	into	basic	questions	like	what	to
wear,	 or	 how	 to	 look,	 what	 to	 say	 first,	 we	 have	 to	 ask	 a	 more	 important
question.	 A	 question	 whose	 answer	 will	 affect	 and	 change	 everything	 listed
above.

Which	women	do	you	want	to	meet	and	what	kind	of	relationship	do	you	want	to
have	with	them?

Context.	Whether	you	chat	a	woman	up	in	a	coffee	shop,	introduce	yourself	at	a
business	 networking	 event,	 or	 attend	 a	 speed	 dating	 event	 is	 going	 to	 make	 a
huge	difference.

This	 question	 of	 where	 and	 in	 what	 context	 you	 meet	 women	 is	 what	 I	 call
demographics,	 and	 it	 is	 by-and-large	 ignored	 by	 pretty	 much	 all	 dating	 advice
out	 there	 today.	 This	 absolutely	 boggles	 my	 mind	 since	 social	 interactions	 are
always	contextual,	and	therefore,	attracting	women	is	always	contextual.

Some	dating	advice	tells	a	40-year-old	divorced	banker	meeting	women	at	an	art
gallery	 the	 same	 advice	 that	 they	 tell	 a	 19-year-old	 college	 kid	 sneaking	 into
house	parties.	This	is	stupid.	These	two	men	have	completely	different	priorities,
life	 experiences,	 personalities,	 and	 interests,	 and	 the	 women	 they’re	 going	 to
meet	 in	those	two	 locations	 are	going	to	be	different	in	age,	education,	values,
emotional	development,	appearance,	and	interests.	That	some	advice	would	give
these	 men	 the	 exact	 same	 lines	 or	 strategies	 to	 use	 just	 goes	 to	 show	 how
completely	out	of	tune	a	lot	of	men’s	dating	advice	is	today.

The	theory	of	demographics	is	simple	and	easy	to	remember:	like	attracts	like.
You	attract	what	you	are.

If	 you’re	 a	 successful	 professional	 who	 likes	 fine	 wine,	 studied	 abroad	 and
dresses	well,	chances	are	the	type	of	women	you’re	going	to	naturally	meet	and
attract	in	your	everyday	life	are	going	to	be	similarly	educated,	similar	looking
women	with	similar	interests	and	similar	success.

When	demographics	don’t	match	up,	then	it	causes	friction.	And	as	we	learned
in	Chapter	3,	friction	prevents	attraction	from	turning	into	intimacy	and/or	sex.

A	 common	 demographic	 mismatch	 scenario	 that	 I’ve	 seen	 many	 times	 is	 the
nerdy	guy	who	decides	to	try	and	become	a	player.	Let’s	say	we	have	a	35-year-
old	 engineer	 named	 John.	 John	 has	 been	 a	 bookworm	 and	 shut-in	 all	 his	 life.
He’s	 had	 two	 serious	 girlfriends,	 both	 lasting	 more	 than	 five	 years	 each.	 He’s
recently	single	and	has	decided	that	he	wants	to	date	and	meet	as	many	women
as	possible	before	he	gets	married.	So	John	reads	some	pick	up	artist	book	and
begins	hitting	the	nightclubs	with	the	new	“techniques”	he’s	learned.

Now,	let’s	ignore	the	lines	he	uses	for	a	moment	—	in	fact,	let’s	assume	the	lines
he	uses	are	good	(even	though	they’re	probably	not).	He	approaches	a	very	hot
blond	girl	named	Jenna.

Jenna	is	20-years-old	and	in	her	second	year	at	community	college.	She	comes
from	a	worse	part	of	town	and	has	been	working	a	retail	job	at	a	shoe	store	for
the	 last	 few	 years	 to	 put	 herself	 through	 school.	 Jenna	 has	 no	 clue	 what	 she
wants	to	do	with	her	life.	In	fact,	she	has	trouble	thinking	about	the	future.	She’s
gone	into	debt	buying	clothes	and	spends	more	time	at	parties	than	studying	or
doing	homework.

John	has	three	degrees,	has	spent	the	last	eight	years	working	60	hours	per	week
and	never	drinks.	He’s	maybe	been	to	20	parties	in	his	entire	life	and	has	only
been	drunk	twice.	He’s	passive	and	analytical	and	his	sense	of	humor	is	highly
intellectual.	He’s	soft-spoken	and	thoughtful.	He’s	not	dressed	entirely	well	and
his	hair	is	unkempt.	He	wears	big	glasses	and	is	slightly	shorter	than	average.

It’s	 not	 hard	 to	 see	 that	 when	 he	 meets	 Jenna,	 no	 matter	 what	 he	 says	 or	 what
line	he	uses,	it’s	going	to	end	quickly,	and	chances	are	Jenna	is	not	going	to	be
subtle	about	her	lack	of	interest	in	John.

John	 may	 come	 away	 blaming	 the	 lines	 he	 used	 for	 not	 working.	 Or	 he	 may
blame	himself	for	being	ugly	or	being	a	little	short.	But	the	fact	of	the	matter	is
that	 it’s	 just	 a	 simple	 incompatibility.	 John’s	 values	 don’t	 line	 up	 with	 Jenna’s.
Jenna’s	 lifestyle	 and	 interests	 don’t	 mesh	 with	 John’s.	 John	 is	 older	 but	 less
experienced.	 Jenna	 is	 younger	 but	 more	 experienced.	 John	 is	 mature	 and
practical.	Jenna	 is	immature	and	 impulsive.	There	are	 mismatches	 going	 on	all
over	the	place.

But	let’s	keep	the	thought	experiment	going.	Let’s	say	two	years	go	by.	In	those
two	years,	John	works	on	himself.	He	dresses	impeccably	now	—	wearing	high-
quality	 clothing	 and	 designer	 brands	 that	 are	 not	 only	 stylish	 but	 reflect	 his
successful	 business	 persona.	 He’s	 well	 groomed.	 He’s	 gone	 to	 the	 gym	 and
buffed	up,	gotten	contacts	instead	of	glasses	and	paid	a	stylist	to	fix	up	his	hair.

John’s	also	discovered	how	to	lighten	up	a	little	bit	and	enjoy	a	party	now	and
then.	Occasionally,	he	goes	out	with	some	of	his	new	young	professional	friends
to	have	drinks	and	a	little	fun.	He’s	begun	spending	more	time	at	the	beach	and
has	 been	 teaching	 himself	 the	 guitar	 on	 and	 off.	 His	 social	 confidence	 has
soared,	and	his	lifestyle	has	expanded	and	grown.

Jenna	 has	 also	 changed	 in	 the	 past	 two	 years.	 Since	 she	 last	 met	 John,	 she’s
dedicated	 herself	 to	 her	 studies.	 She	 just	 got	 into	 nursing	 school	 and	 has	 been
taking	it	seriously	and	realizes	she’s	smarter	than	she	thought	she	was	and	that,
at	times,	she	actually	enjoys	learning.	She	also	got	out	of	a	one-year	relationship
with	 a	 football	 player	 who	 was	 irresponsible	 and	 treated	 her	 like	 crap.	 She’s
realized	that	she	needs	a	man	who	is	more	responsible	than	she	is	and	that	she
needs	to	stand	up	for	herself	and	expect	more	out	of	the	men	she	dates.

This	 time,	 when	 John	 approaches	 her	 (lines	 or	 not),	 they	 suddenly	 have	 an
overlapping	 demographic:	 John	 is	 now	 an	 attractive,	 well-kept,	 successful
bachelor	who	knows	how	to	let	loose,	have	fun	and	express	his	emotions;	Jenna
is	now	not	only	beautiful	but	also	responsible,	ambitious	and	confident.

And	like	that,	there’s	now	mutual	attraction.

Now,	it’s	true	that	if	John	practiced	and	perfected	his	use	of	lines	and	tactics,	he
may	 be	 able	 to	 convince	 Jenna	 in	 the	 short-term	 that	 he’s	 less	 invested	 and	 is
actually	in	her	demographic	(vague	stories	about	his	stripper	ex-girlfriends	and
the	like),	but	hopefully	by	now	you	realize	how	badly	these	kinds	of	strategies
backfire,	 particularly	 in	 the	 long	 run.	 Eventually,	 John’s	 lines	 will	 run	 out	 and
like	Cinderella	after	the	ball,	Jenna	will	be	horrified	at	who	she’s	actually	talking
to.

But	 because	 John	 (and	 Jenna)	 worked	 on	 themselves,	 broadened	 their
demographics,	 enriched	 their	 lifestyles,	 and	 lived	 their	 lives	 in	 ways	 that	 were
more	in	line	with	what	they	wanted,	they	came	to	find	enough	common	ground
to	be	attracted	to	one	another.

This	is	the	power	of	demographics.

And	 notice	 it	 has	 little	 to	 do	 with	 the	 people	 themselves	 —	 whether	 or	 not
they’re	 attracted	 to	 each	 other	 —	 but	 more	 to	 do	 with	 timing.	 Two	 years	 prior
they	 were	 not	 compatible.	 Two	 years	 later,	 they	 are.	 Remember,	 right	 person,
wrong	time.

If	she	loves	to	ski	and	ride	horses,	and	you	hate	the	outdoors	and	traveling,	then
that’s	going	to	cause	friction	—	perhaps	not	immediately,	but	at	some	point.

If	she	values	expressing	her	emotions	openly	and	what	her	friends	think	of	her,
and	you	value	serious	conversation,	intellectual	pursuits	and	don’t	care	much	for
social	gatherings,	there’s	going	to	be	a	large	amount	of	friction	from	the	get-go.

This	 is	 unavoidable.	 Clever	 lines	 won’t	 change	 it.	 Being	 good-looking	 won’t
change	it.	Being	rich	won’t	change	it.	If	you	hate	what	she	loves	and	she	hates
what	you	love,	it’s	not	going	to	go	anywhere.	Period.

The	 answer	 isn’t	 replacing	 your	 identity	 and	 passions;	 the	 answer	 is	 to	 expand
your	 identity	 and	 passions.	 Expand	 it	 to	 include	 new	 and	 interesting	 activities,
new	modes	of	expression,	and	new	ways	of	presenting	yourself.

Demographics	explain	why	you	meet	 women	you	just	“click”	with	sometimes,
and	why,	more	often	than	not,	you	meet	these	women	in	situations	where	you’re
having	fun	and	doing	what	you	love.

Lifestyle	Choices

The	theory	of	demographics	has	advantages	as	well:	if	you	play	to	your	strengths
—	i.e.,	if	you	focus	your	time	and	energy	on	meeting	women	in	situations	where
they	are	likely	to	share	your	values,	interests,	and	needs	—	then	you’re	going	to
not	only	experience	a	much	higher	degree	of	success,	but	you’re	going	to	meet
women	you	enjoy	a	lot	more.

For	instance,	I	love	to	travel.	And	I	love	meeting	women	who	love	to	travel.	It’s
absolutely	my	favorite	thing	to	talk	about	and	typically	if	I	find	a	well-traveled
woman,	I	find	it	very	easy	to	attract	her	and	date	her.

When	 I’m	 in	 a	 random	 bar	 in	 Texas,	 I	 rarely	 meet	 women	 who	 have	 traveled.

But	when	I	go	to	a	European	wine	tasting	in	New	York,	I	almost	meet	nothing
but	women	who	love	to	travel.

Or	 even	 better,	 if	 I	 actually	 get	 up	 and	 go	 to	 another	 country	 and	 meet	 other
people	 traveling	 in	 that	 country,	 I’m	 going	 to	 have	 an	 extremely	 high	 hit-rate
with	those	women.

If	 you	 love	 dancing	 or	 different	 types	 of	 music,	 then	 chances	 are	 the	 women
you’re	going	to	meet	at	various	dance	events	and	concerts	are	going	to	be	more
compatible	with	you	and	you’re	going	to	have	much	more	success	with	them.

Bars	 and	 nightclubs	 are	 generally	 considered	 “meet	 markets”	 or	 the	 obvious
places	everyone	goes	to	meet	someone.	But	think	about	the	people	and	context
in	which	you’re	walking	into	in	a	bar	or	nightclub:	a	high-energy,	generic	party
situation,	where	people	value	having	fun	and	spending	time	with	their	friends.

Assuming	you’re	a	guy	who	loves	to	party,	have	fun,	and	hang	out	with	a	bunch
of	new	friends,	that’s	great.	But	if	you’re	not	that	naturally	outgoing	social	type,
then	chances	are	you’re	not	going	to	be	very	compatible	with	most	of	the	people
there.

It	 isn’t	 until	 you	 develop	 that	 aspect	 of	 your	 personality	 or	 lifestyle	 that	 those
women	will	begin	to	open	up	to	you.

What	I	recommend	to	every	man	before	he	even	begins	talking	to	women	is	to
sit	down	for	a	while	and	ask	himself	a	few	questions:

-	 What	 do	 you	 value	 in	 a	 woman?	 Honesty?	 Beauty?	 Affection?
Intelligence?	 Curiosity?	 Similar	 interests?	 Education?	 Obviously,	 the
answer	is	“all	of	the	above”,	right?	So	let	me	rephrase	the	question:	what	do
you	 value	 the	 most?	 What	 is	 an	 absolute	 deal-breaker	 in	 the	 women	 you
date?	 Prioritize	 what	 you	 look	 for	 in	 a	 woman.	 This	 will	 help	 you	 decide
where	to	look.

-	Women	with	the	traits	that	you	value,	where	do	they	frequent?	Where	are
you	most	likely	to	find	them?

-	What	do	you	enjoy	doing	most?	Do	you	love	to	read/write?	Do	you	play
music?	 Do	 you	 enjoy	 sports	 and	 competitions?	 What	 are	 the	 events	 or

organizations	that	you	can	become	involved	in	that	explore	your	hobbies?

-	If	you	don’t	know	what	your	passions	and	interests	are,	take	a	minute	and
write	down	things	that	you’ve	always	wanted	to	do	but	have	never	had	the
time	or	never	worked	up	the	nerve	to	do.	Make	a	promise	to	yourself	to	get
involved	in	that	activity	or	event	in	some	way.

Obviously,	not	every	interest	is	going	to	be	overflowing	with	women.	If	you	are
a	 competitive	 chess	 player,	 you	 probably	 won’t	 meet	 many	 women	 at	 chess
tournaments.	But	few	people	have	only	one	passion	or	interest.	And	chances	are
that	you	have	at	least	a	few	things	that	you’re	interested	in	that	are	overflowing
with	women.

Here	 are	 examples	 of	 some	 great	 hobbies/events	 that	 you	 can	 use	 to	 meet
women:

-	Dance	classes	(salsa,	swing,	ballroom,	etc.)
-	Political	organizations	or	events
-	Concerts	and	concert	promotions
-	Amateur	sports	leagues	(ultimate	frisbee	and	co-ed	volleyball	tend	to	have
a	lot	of	women	—	women	in	good	shape	too)
-	 Volunteering,	 charities,	 charities	 events	 (usually	 overloaded	 with	 great
women)
-	Training	courses	(leadership,	public	speaking)
-	Cooking	classes
-	Yoga	classes	(a	goldmine)
-	Meditation	courses	and	retreats
-	Self-help	seminars	and	educational	events
-	Travel	groups	(i.e.,	couch	surfing)
-	For	the	religious:	a	church	or	whatever	your	faith’s	equivalent	is
-	Educational	classes	(foreign	language,	CPA,	etc.)
-	Dog	parks
-	Wine	or	beer	tastings
-	Art	galleries,	exhibits	or	showings
-	Business	networking	events

Also,	meetup.com	and	livingsocial.com	are	excellent	resources	for	finding	like-
minded	people	and	cool	events	going	on	in	your	city.

I	have	a	friend	who	is	an	excellent	dancer	and	goes	to	the	local	dance	events	in
the	every	week.	He’s	successful,	smart	and	professional.	He’s	cultured	and	well-
traveled.	He	also	networks	through	European	entrepreneurs	living	and	working
in	 the	 US.	 Between	 these	 two	 groups,	 he	 meets	 tons	 of	 people	 and	 tons	 of
attractive,	 intelligent	 women.	 To	 kick	 things	 off,	 he	 often	 brings	 them	 together
by	 hosting	 events	 at	 his	 house.	 His	 consistent	 success	 with	 women	 comes	 not
just	from	his	charisma	and	his	“game,”	but	the	fact	that	he’s	narrowed	down	the
demographic	of	women	who	he	likes	and	who	are	apt	to	like	him	and	acts	on	it.

A	much	simpler	example	is	another	friend	I	have	who	is	a	professional	musician.
You	would	think	he’d	be	getting	laid	all	the	time,	but	he	actually	spent	most	of
his	time	in	the	studio	and	rehearsal	rooms.	That’s	where	the	real	payday	was.

But	when	he	became	single	again,	he	began	taking	cheap	and	easy	gigs,	playing
weddings,	dive	bars,	in	cover	bands,	etc.	and	quickly	met	more	women	than	he
knew	what	to	do	with.

In	my	own	life,	I	have	a	strong	passion	for	traveling	and	culture.	Wherever	I	go,
I	make	a	point	to	join	local	events	or	classes	where	I’ll	meet	other	like-minded
people	who	also	travel.	When	I’m	in	the	US,	I	spend	my	time	at	venues	or	events
that	are	likely	to	have	foreigners.

Whenever	 I’m	 in	 the	 US	 and	 I	 meet	 a	 woman	 from	 say,	 Argentina,	 and	 I
immediately	start	telling	her	about	the	three	months	I	lived	in	Buenos	Aires	—	in
Spanish	—	it’s	pretty	easy	to	get	a	date	with	her,	as	you	can	imagine.

The	 answer	 for	 you	 is	 going	 to	 be	 completely	 different.	 You’ll	 have	 to
experiment.	These	are	just	some	successful	examples.

Demographics	 affect	 every	 interaction	 you	 have	 with	 women.	 If	 there	 is	 too
large	of	a	demographic	mismatch,	then	the	friction	will	be	incredibly	high,	and
no	matter	how	attractive	you	are,	she	will	not	be	able	to	connect	with	you.

This	may	explain	a	fair	amount	of	failure	you’ve	had	up	until	this	point.

Expand	your	interests	and	pursue	them.

If	you’re	interested	in	spirituality	and	meditation,	pursue	it.	If	you’re	interested
in	politics	and	being	active	in	your	community,	pursue	it.	If	you’re	interested	in
food	 from	 around	 the	 world,	 pursue	 it.	 Take	 up	 cooking	 classes,	 food	 tastings,

restaurant	openings,	etc.

Beliefs	and	Self-Selection

Lifestyle	choices	play	an	obvious	role	in	the	demographic	of	women	we	would
like	 to	 meet.	 If	 you	 like	 to	 do	 yoga,	 and	 if	 you	 go	 do	 yoga,	 you’ll	 meet	 other
women	who	like	to	do	yoga.	They’ll	likely	be	attracted	to	you	and	you’ll	likely
be	attracted	to	them.	Duh.

What’s	not	quite	as	obvious	but	just	as	important,	if	not	more	important,	is	how
our	 beliefs	 naturally	 screen	 the	 women	 who	 come	 into	 our	 lives.	 When	 I	 say
beliefs,	I	mean	beliefs	about	women,	sex,	relationships,	and	ourselves.

The	idea	is	that	our	beliefs	are	reflected	in	our	behavior,	and	behavior	determines
which	(and	how	many)	women	are	attracted	to	us.

For	instance,	if	you	believe	all	women	are	sluts	and	untrustworthy,	then	the	only
women	 who	 are	 going	 to	 be	 willing	 to	 tolerate	 your	 judgmental	 attitude	 are
promiscuous	women	who	are	untrustworthy.	Social	psychology	refers	to	this	as
the	assortment	effect	and	it's	been	demonstrated	in	many	studies.

Another	example	is	the	belief	that	women	want	and	enjoy	sex	as	much	as	men
do.	 This	 belief	 was	 a	 big	 one	 for	 me.	 Many	 men	 don’t	 believe	 that	 women
actually	enjoy	or	fantasize	about	sex.

So	 how	 would	 this	 belief	 affect	 your	 behavior	 and	 screen	 the	 women	 who	 are
attracted	to	you?

If	 you	 believe	 women	 don’t	 or	 shouldn’t	 enjoy	 sex,	 then	 the	 women	 who	 do
enjoy	sex	will	most	likely	not	feel	comfortable	expressing	their	sexuality	around
you.	And	the	women	who	do	not	enjoy	sex	will	feel	like	you	understand	them.

Thus,	you’ll	be	stuck	dating	a	bunch	of	women	disconnected	from	their	sexuality
and	uncomfortable	having	sex	with	you.

But	if	you	believe	that	women	do	enjoy	sex,	then	the	women	who	do	enjoy	sex
will	 feel	 comfortable	 expressing	 their	 sexuality	 around	 you,	 while	 the	 women
who	 are	 not	 comfortable	 expressing	 their	 sexuality	 will	 not	 be	 comfortable
around	you.	Yes,	this	will	invite	rejections,	but	remember,	rejections	are	a	form

of	screening	for	demographics	and	in	this	case,	it’s	doing	you	a	favor.

You’ll	end	up	with	a	bunch	of	sexual	and	sensual	women	who	enjoy	being	with
you.	Nothing	wrong	with	that!

The	 assortment	 effect	 through	 personal	 beliefs	 is	 incredibly	 powerful.	 I	 think
that	 most	 “problems”	 men	 try	 to	 overcome	 with	 tactics	 and	 techniques	 could
easily	be	solved	by	simply	questioning	our	beliefs.

I	 always	 like	 to	 tell	 men,	 “The	 only	 thing	 all	 of	 the	 women	 you	 date	 have	 in
common	 is	 you.”	 What	 I	 mean	 by	 that	 is	 if	 all	 of	 the	 women	 you	 date	 end	 up
lying	 and	 being	 manipulative,	 or	 if	 all	 of	 the	 women	 you	 date	 are	 selfish	 and
treat	 you	 poorly,	 or	 if	 all	 of	 the	 women	 you	 date	 are	 meek	 and	 have	 no
personality,	 then	 likely	 there	 is	 something	 in	 your	 beliefs	 and	 behavior	 that	 is
naturally	screening	for	those	types	of	women.

A	blunter	way	of	putting	it	is:	whether	you	realize	it	or	not,	the	results	you	get
with	women	are	always	your	fault.

Unfortunately,	 questioning	 and	 re-evaluating	 our	 beliefs	 about	 women	 and
relationships	 is	 far	 harder	 and	 more	 uncomfortable	 than	 simply	 memorizing	 a
pick	up	line	or	two.	That’s	why	most	men	don’t	ever	bother	doing	it.	And	that’s
why	these	men	never	experience	long-term	success.

I	think	acknowledging	your	beliefs	and	also	being	able	to	acknowledge	that	they
may	not	be	true	comes	back	to	what	was	discussed	in	Chapter	3:	being	able	to
take	 an	 open	 and	 honest	 look	 at	 yourself	 and	 your	 desires.	 Becoming	 a	 non-
needy	 man	 requires,	 first	 and	 foremost,	 a	 high	 level	 of	 honesty	 with	 yourself.
Part	of	that	honesty	with	yourself	involves	observing	and	challenging	your	own
beliefs.	If	you	have	lived	your	entire	life	believing	women	are	untrustworthy	or
that	 women	 who	 express	 their	 sexuality	 are	 immoral,	 then	 perhaps	 you	 should
evaluate	 what	 kind	 of	 women	 those	 beliefs	 are	 going	 to	 attract	 into	 your	 life.
And	 if	 you	 don’t	 want	 to	 attract	 those	 kinds	 of	 women,	 perhaps	 you	 should
experiment	with	changing	your	beliefs.

Now	you’re	probably	saying:	“Experiment	with	changing	my	beliefs?	How	the
hell	do	I	do	that?”

You	change	your	beliefs	by	simply	accepting	the	fact	that	you	don’t	know	what
you’re	talking	about	and	then	you	open	yourself	to	coming	to	other	conclusions.

If	you	believe	that	all	women	are	evil	and	manipulative,	consciously	decide	that
you	 may	 not	 know	 what	 you’re	 talking	 about,	 and	 then	 go	 out	 and	 test	 new
hypotheses	 out	 in	 the	 real	 world.	 Go	 to	 an	 event	 and	 pretend	 that	 all	 of	 the
women	you	meet	are	loving,	caring,	and	honest.	Get	online	and	message	women
imagining	that	every	one	of	them	is	interested	in	you	for	you	and	not	for	some
ulterior	motive.	See	what	happens.	Sure,	it	will	freak	you	out	at	first,	but	you’ll
quickly	notice	a	shift	in	the	caliber	of	women	you	attract	and	your	relationships
will	improve.

Because	 here’s	 the	 amazing	 thing	 about	 people,	 both	 men	 and	 women:	 people
tend	to	conform	to	what	we	expect	of	them.

For	 instance,	 let’s	 say	 you	 get	 a	 new	 job	 and	 your	 new	 boss	 immediately
assumes	you’re	a	dick.	He	talks	down	to	you,	rolls	his	eyes	at	you,	and	acts	as	if
your	mere	presence	is	an	insult	to	everything	he	stands	for.

How	would	you	end	up	behaving	towards	him?	That’s	right,	you’d	start	acting
like	a	dick.	He	treats	you	badly	because	he	expects	you	to	be	a	dick.	And	you
start	acting	like	a	dick	because	he’s	treating	you	badly.

The	same	is	true	with	women	and	dating.	If	you	meet	and	date	women	believing
fucked	up	stuff	about	them,	you	will	only	encourage	that	fucked	up	behavior.	If
you	never	trust	the	woman	you’re	with	and	are	always	jealous,	then	you’re	just
going	to	encourage	her	to	do	things	behind	your	back.	After	all,	she’s	going	to
get	yelled	at	by	you	anyway,	so	she	decides	to	start	withholding	information.

If	 you’re	 condescending	 and	 treat	 a	 woman	 like	 she’s	 a	 child	 who	 can’t	 make
any	decisions	for	herself,	then	she	will	act	like	a	spoiled	child	and	stop	making
any	decisions	for	herself.

In	the	therapeutic	world,	this	is	often	referred	to	as	“enabling:”	when	our	shitty
behavior	encourages	the	people	around	us	to	adopt	shitty	behavior.

Demographics,	 and	 more	 importantly,	 analyzing	 our	 beliefs	 about	 relationships
before	we	even	start	pursuing	one,	allows	us	to	avoid	these	problems	before	they
even	happen,	to	avoid	the	disastrous	breakups	before	they	can	ever	occur.

Because	 ultimately,	 we	 attract	 who	 we	 are.	 And	 if	 we	 are	 a	 mean,	 vindictive,
jealous	or	distrustful	person	–	well,	who	do	you	think	you’ll	end	up	being	with?

Age,	Money,	and	Looks

The	touchiest	part	of	demographics	—	and	possibly	the	touchiest	subject	of	all
dating	advice	—	is	that	of	age,	money,	and	looks.

I	want	to	get	this	out	of	the	way	and	make	it	100%	clear.	Age,	money,	and	looks
matter	—	in	some	cases	a	lot,	in	other	cases,	not	a	lot,	but	they	still	matter.	And
anyone	who	tells	you	that	they	don’t	matter	is	lying.

With	that	said,	age,	money,	and	looks	don’t	matter	nearly	as	much	as	most	men
think.	And	if	you’re	aware	of	the	effects	of	demographics,	you	can	work	around
them	and	even	work	them	to	your	advantage.

When	it	comes	to	age,	studies	show	that	men’s	physical	attractiveness	peaks	at
around	31	(a	luxury	considering	women	peak	around	21)	and	that	our	physical
attractiveness	 recedes	 far	 slower	 than	 it	 does	 for	 women.	 In	 fact,	 studies	 have
found	 that	 the	 average	 45-year-old	 male	 is	 still	 considered	 as	 physically
attractive	as	the	average	18-year-old	male.

The	main	reason	is	that	studies	have	also	found	that	women	judge	a	man’s	status
far	less	on	actual	physical	dimensions	and	far	more	on	style,	grooming,	and	how
men	present	themselves.	As	men,	we’re	extremely	lucky	in	this	regard.	Taking	a
man	 from	 a	 baggy	 beer	 T-shirt	 and	 ill-fitted	 jeans	 to	 a	 nice	 suit	 with	 a
professional	haircut	will	immediately	bump	him	up	50%	in	the	looks	department
overnight,	 whereas	 with	 women,	 it’s	 a	 constant	 and	 never-ending	 battle	 to
maximize	their	physical	appearance	as	much	as	possible.

How	to	be	as	good-looking	as	possible	will	be	covered	in	depth	in	the	following
chapter,	but	for	now,	just	know	that	no	matter	how	ugly	you	think	you	are	(and
chances	 are,	 you	 aren’t),	 there’s	 hope	 for	 you.	 And	 we’ll	 take	 care	 of	 it	 soon
enough.

Money	 is	 nice	 in	 that	 it	 demonstrates	 success	 and	 implies	 other	 positive
attractive	 traits.	 But	 again,	 its	 utility	 is	 vastly	 overblown.	 When	 it	 comes	 to
money,	once	again	the	surveys	and	studies	have	some	interesting	findings.

The	first	is	that	money/success	matters	more	depending	on	your	age.	The	older
you	are,	the	more	money	you’re	expected	to	have	and	the	more	successful	you’re
expected	to	be	in	order	to	be	attractive.	The	other	finding	is	that	the	less	wealthy
she	is,	the	more	important	money	will	be	to	her.

This	 is	 why	 the	 stereotypical	 gold-digger	 is	 usually	 a	 very	 beautiful	 young
woman	 who	 grew	 up	 in	 poverty.	 Women	 who	 grow	 up	 with	 money	 or	 have
money	usually	don’t	care	about	it	as	much.

But	 the	 fact	 remains	 that	 women	 perceive	 men	 with	 money	 the	 same	 way	 we
perceive	 women	 with	 good	 looks:	 as	 social	 status.	 How	 each	 woman	 defines
social	 status	 and	 whether	 money	 is	 a	 part	 of	 that	 or	 not	 is	 going	 to	 vary	 from
woman	to	woman.

Which	brings	me	to	my	primary	point	when	it	comes	to	age,	money,	and	looks.
Again,	it’s	about	the	demographics.

I	saw	a	quote	recently	that	said,	“Only	lazy	women	are	interested	in	 men	with
money,	because	they	don’t	have	anything	else	going	for	them.”

Ask	 yourself	 for	 which	 demographic	 of	 women	 are	 looks	 and	 money	 highly
important?	 Women	 who	 tend	 to	 only	value	 good	 looks	 tend	 to	 be	 women	 who
only	have	good	looks	and	little	else	to	offer.	Women	who	are	highly	interested	in
money	are	going	to	be	women	who	don’t	have	other	interests	or	opportunities	in
front	of	them.

What	I’m	saying	is,	women	who	only	care	about	things	such	as	looks	and	money
are	usually	going	to	be	women	who	you’re	not	going	to	be	interested	in	or	who
are	not	going	to	make	you	happy.	So	you’re	not	missing	out	on	much.

With	that	said,	everybody	values	looks	and	success	to	a	certain	extent.	So	it’s	not
something	we	can	write	off	completely.	You	should	be	as	good-looking	as	you
can	possibly	be.	And	you	should	be	as	financially	successful	as	you	can	possibly
be.	And	even	the	most	interesting	and	well-rounded	and	psychologically	healthy
women	are	still	going	to	prefer	a	good-looking	and	successful	man	to	one	who
isn’t.	All	things	equal,	looks	and	money	always	increase	your	odds.

But	I	would	just	add	the	caveat	that	you	should	be	as	good-looking	as	possible
for	you.	You	 should	be	as	financially	successful	as	possible	for	you.	 These	 are
just	other	avenues	in	which	to	invest	in	yourself.

So	 yes,	 looks	 and	 money	 matter.	 But	 the	 question	 is,	 how	 do	 they	 affect	 our
results	with	the	majority	of	women?

The	 more	 money/looks/success	 you	 have,	 the	 less	 attractive	 behavior	 you
need.	 The	 less	 money/looks/success	 you	 have,	 the	 more	 attractive	 behavior
you	need.

Another	 way	 to	 think	 of	 this	 is	 that	 age,	 money,	 and	 looks	 are	 universal
demographics,	 and	 therefore,	 an	 incompatibility	 in	 any	 one	 of	 them	 is	 apt	 to
cause	extra	friction	everywhere.

But	 just	 because	 there’s	 friction,	 or	 just	 because	 there	 are	 fewer	 Receptive
women,	it’s	no	excuse	for	not	having	success	in	the	long	run.

The	vast	majority	of	men	who	get	hung	up	on	looks	and	money	get	hung	up	on
them	because	they’re	using	it	as	an	excuse.	It’s	absolutely	not	a	valid	excuse.	A
guy	who	is	good-looking	or	rich	still	has	to	work	for	his	results;	he	just	doesn’t
have	to	work	as	hard	as	the	next	guy.

Trust	 me,	 I’ve	 coached	 hundreds	 of	 men	 who	 were	 far	 more	 professionally
successful	than	me	and	far	better	looking	than	me,	yet	I	still	dated	more	women
and	 more	 beautiful	 women	 than	 them.	 Being	 good-looking	 and	 being	 rich	 is
worth	nothing	if	you	don’t	do	something	with	it.	You	can	be	the	richest	guy	in
the	world,	but	if	you	behave	like	a	timid,	negative	and	weak	chump,	then	women
will	still	be	repelled.

And	 as	 we’ll	 discuss	 in	 the	 next	 chapter,	 anyone	 can	 be	 handsome	 and	 appear
high-status	if	they	put	enough	effort	into	it.	So	no	excuses.

And	 of	 course,	 status	 is	 ultimately	 determined	 by	 demographics.	 At	 a	 college
house	party,	a	burly	20-year-old	kid	who	crushes	beer	cans	on	his	head	is	going
to	 have	 a	 high	 level	 of	 status	 to	 the	 girls	 there.	 At	 an	 opening	 at	 a	 local	 art
gallery,	he	is	going	to	have	almost	none.	A	skinny	bass-playing	hipster	is	going
to	have	high	status	at	a	local	indie	show	and	low	status	at	a	business-networking
event.	A	successful	stock	trader	who	wears	Armani	suits	is	going	to	have	high
status	 at	 his	 firm’s	 annual	 Christmas	 party	 and	 little	 status	 at	 a	 hippy	 music
festival.

It’s	all	relative.	The	key	is	to	1)	recognize	your	personal	interests	and	strengths,
and	2)	build	upon	those	personal	interests	and	strengths	to	quickly	attract	women
in	your	preferred	demographic.

Social	Proof

The	 concept	 of	 social	 proof	 comes	 from	 influence	 psychology	 and	 is	 well
documented	 in	 everything	 from	 salesmanship	 to	 advertising,	 to	 politics,	 and	 to
attraction	and	relationships.

The	idea	is	that	as	humans	when	we	see	many	other	people	valuing	something,
we	 will	 unconsciously	 value	 it	 ourselves.	 For	 instance,	 if	 everybody	 else	 is
talking	 about	 a	 new	 movie,	 we	 are	 more	 likely	 to	 want	 to	 see	 it	 because	 we’ll
unconsciously	assume	that	it’s	a	good	or	important	movie	to	see.

This	works	with	people	as	well.	If	you’re	at	a	party	and	someone	walks	in	and
everybody	 in	 the	 party	 stops	 what	 they’re	 doing	 to	 turn	 and	 say	 hello	 to	 that
person,	your	first	thought	would	probably	be,	“Wow,	who	is	that	guy?”	Chances
are	you’d	want	to	meet	him	as	well.

The	idea	is	that	this	applies	to	women	and	attraction	as	well.	If	you	are	that	man
who	walks	into	a	room	and	everybody	stops	what	they	are	doing	to	talk	to	you,
then	the	women	in	the	room	are	more	likely	to	perceive	you	as	high	status	and	be
attracted	to	you.	Or	if	you’re	a	man	with	whom	multiple	women	are	flirting,	then
it’s	going	to	incite	even	more	women	to	begin	flirting	with	you.

This	is	one	reason	why	men	in	power	—	celebrities,	athletes,	etc.	—	are	desired
by	 so	 many	 women.	 The	 goal,	 as	 a	 man,	 is	 to	 cultivate	 as	 much	 social	 proof
within	your	demographic	as	possible.

So,	for	instance,	if	you	are	a	high-powered	executive	at	your	firm,	then	you	have
a	large	degree	of	social	status	and	social	proof	at	work.	Chances	are,	the	women
who	work	with	you	are	going	to	have	some	degree	of	attraction	for	you.	But	if
you	go	to	a	bar	on	the	weekend	and	know	nobody	there,	then	your	social	status
is	back	to	nothing.	You’re	just	another	man	there.

Social	proof	only	functions	within	a	demographic	itself.	That’s	why	once	you’ve
narrowed	down	your	demographic,	you	want	to	cultivate	your	connections	and
put	yourself	into	as	big	of	a	leadership	position	as	possible.	Don’t	just	join	the
intramural	 ultimate	 Frisbee	 team,	 start	 organizing	 it.	 Don’t	 just	 volunteer	 at	 a
charity	event,	help	find	sponsors	for	it.	Don’t	just	go	hang	out	at	a	local	club,	but
become	a	promoter	for	it.

Part	of	living	the	honest	lifestyle	is	to	pursue	what	you’re	passionate	about	to	the

fullest	 extent.	 If	 you	 absolutely	 love	 visiting	 art	 exhibitions,	 don’t	 just	 visit	 a
bunch	of	art	exhibitions,	but	take	an	active	role	in	the	organization,	start	a	meet
up	 group	 to	 find	 other	 people	 who	 want	 to	 visit	 them,	 or	 create	 a	 forum	 for
commentary.	Don’t	just	pursue	your	interests,	become	a	leader	in	your	interests.
Don’t	just	choose	a	demographic	of	women	to	meet,	dominate	the	demographic.

Hopefully	by	now	you’re	getting	a	clearer	idea	of	what	demographic	of	women
you’re	 currently	 attracting	 and	 which	 demographic	 of	 women	 you’d	 like	 to
attract.	 In	 the	 next	 chapter,	 we	 will	 get	 into	 specifics	 on	 how	 to	 pursue	 the
correct	demographic	for	you	and	become	as	attractive	as	you	possibly	can	be.

Being	Something	Versus	Saying	Something

If	there’s	one	takeaway	from	this	chapter,	it’s	that	it	is	far	more	powerful	to	be
something	 attractive	 rather	 than	 to	 say	 something	 attractive.	 You	 can	 say	 the
most	attractive	sentence	in	the	world,	but	if	it	isn’t	backed	up	by	who	you	are,
then	it’s	not	going	to	have	any	meaning.	Whereas	if	you	are	something	amazing,
then	 anything	 you	 say	 will	 be	 attractive	 because	 it	 will	 be	 coming	 from	 a
genuinely	attractive	man.

Women	are	attracted	to	your	identity.	Words	mean	nothing.	What	you	say	is	only
a	means	to	buy	you	enough	time	to	show	her	that	identity.	Notice	I	said	“show
her”	not	“tell	her.”

For	 instance,	 imagine	 you	 meet	 two	 different	 men.	 One	 of	 them	 is	 a	 scrubby,
ugly,	 and	 shady	 character.	 He	 can’t	 look	 you	 in	 the	 eye.	 He	 smells	 bad.	 He
mumbles	to	himself	and	scratches	himself	in	inappropriate	places.	While	you’re
talking	to	him,	he	looks	at	you	and	says,	“You	know,	I	get	a	good	feeling	from
you,	you’re	someone	worth	knowing.”

How	would	that	make	you	feel?

You’d	probably	get	the	creeps	and	want	to	get	away	from	him	as	quickly	as	you
could.

Now	imagine	you’re	talking	to	a	handsome,	successful	man	who	is	charismatic
and	charming.	Everything	he	says	is	fascinating	and	interesting.	Then	he	looks
you	 in	 the	 eye	 and	 says,	 “You	 know,	 I	 get	 a	 good	 feeling	 from	 you,	 you’re
someone	worth	knowing.”

How	would	that	make	you	feel?

It’d	 make	 your	 day.	 Why?	 Because	 the	 second	 man	 is	 someone.	 He’s	 not	 just
saying	 interesting	 and	 charming	 things,	 but	 he	 is	 interesting	 and	 charming.
Suddenly	 the	 words	 that	 come	 out	 of	 his	 mouth	 have	 a	 whole	 new	 weight	 and
meaning.

Again,	a	lot	of	men	take	this	as	another	invitation	to	perform.	Last	night,	I	was	in
a	restaurant	with	my	girlfriend.	It	was	a	nice	and	expensive	restaurant.	A	couple
sat	down	at	the	table	next	to	us.	They	were	clearly	on	a	date.	The	man	was	a	bit
older	and	the	woman	was	young	and	beautiful.	The	man	immediately	closed	the
menu	 and	 said,	 “Don’t	 order	 anything,	 I	 know	 something	 special	 that’s	 not	 on
the	 menu	 and	 you’re	 going	 to	 eat	 it.”	 The	 woman	 kind	 of	 meekly	 said,	 “OK.”
The	 man	 then	 argued	 with	 the	 waiter	 about	 cooking	 some	 mystery	 dish	 that
wasn’t	on	the	menu.	The	man	and	the	waiter	went	back	and	forth	and	soon	it	was
apparent	 to	 all	 of	 those	 sitting	 in	 our	 section	 that	 something	 awkward	 and
unnecessary	was	taking	place.	The	woman	became	bored,	irritated	and	was	soon
deeply	enmeshed	in	her	phone,	checking	Facebook,	Instagram,	Twitter,	anything
to	get	her	away	from	this	bonehead	sitting	across	from	her.

In	the	man’s	mind,	he	probably	saw	himself	as	a	successful,	powerful	man.	What
I	 saw	 was	 a	 pathetic	 performance,	 overcompensation,	 a	 keen	 narcissism.	 A
successful	man	doesn’t	need	to	prove	he’s	successful	by	ordering	something	not
on	the	menu.	A	powerful	man	doesn’t	have	to	decree	to	his	date	what	she’s	going
to	eat	that	night.

This	is	why	trying	to	impress	women	by	flaunting	an	image	of	what	you	think	is
attractive	 will	 always	 backfire.	 Men	 can	 go	 out	 and	 perform	 as	 much	 as	 they
want	—	for	weeks,	months,	or	even	years	—	and	they’ll	never	get	good	results
because	 they’re	 not	 portraying	 themselves	 well.	 They	 don’t	 have	 a	 clear	 and
successful	 identity.	 They	 aren’t	 in	 touch	 with	 the	 way	 in	 which	 they’re	 living
their	lives.

When	you’re	like	this	man	–	when	you’re	focused	so	much	on	performing	rather
than	actually	being	–	then	you	are	out	of	touch	with	your	identity,	who	you	are,
and	what	you	want.	And	when	you’re	out	of	touch	with	yourself,	you	will	fall
into	 the	 abyss	 of	 vague	 and	 empty	 demographics.	 You	 will	 aimlessly	 claw	 for
whatever	woman	comes	near	you.	You	will	be	left	bewildered	at	how	you	seem
unable	to	polarize	anyone.

Discovering	your	truth	and	establishing	your	identity	is	necessary	to	determine
the	 demographics	 of	 women	 you	 desire	 and	 the	 demographics	 of	 women	 you
appeal	 to.	 And,	 as	 we’ll	 see,	 working	 your	 demographics	 underlies	 everything
else	in	dating.

Hopefully	this	chapter	has	helped	you	question	what	you’re	doing	with	your	life,
what	your	identity	is,	what	you	want	out	of	your	relationships,	and	what	kind	of
women	you’d	like	to	attract.

The	next	chapter	is	going	to	get	into	specifics	on	how	to	build	up	an	attractive
lifestyle	within	your	chosen	identity	and	within	your	chosen	demographic.

Chapter	8:
Lifestyle	and	Presentation

As	men,	we’re	prone	to	assume	that	women	perceive	attraction	in	the	same	way
we	do.	Science	and	psychology	show	that	this	isn’t	the	case.

Men	 judge	 female	 beauty	 by	 physical	 traits	 first,	 personality	 and	 presentation
second:	high	cheekbones,	facial	symmetry,	waist-to-hip	ratio,	breast	size,	etc.	As
such,	we	often	fall	into	the	mistake	that	women	judge	our	attractiveness	with	the
same	metrics;	hence,	obsessions	with	bench	presses,	height,	and	penis	pills.

Yes,	physical	measurements	play	a	role	in	how	a	man’s	appearance	is	judged,	but
research	shows	that	other	factors	are	more	important.

That’s	 why	 I	 draw	 the	 distinction	 between	 being	 good-looking	 and	 being
attractive.	 Not	 everybody	 is	 born	 good-looking.	 But	 any	 man,	 with	 some	 time
and	 effort,	 can	 become	 attractive.	 And	 in	 the	 end,	 what	 women	 want	 is	 a	 man
who	is	attractive.

For	some	reason,	many	men	believe	that	their	physical	appearance	is	set	in	stone
and	 they	 rarely	 have	 any	 interest	 in	 altering	 it	 or	 making	 any	 major	 changes.
What	they	don’t	understand	is	that	the	same	man	can	present	himself	in	varying
ways,	some	of	which	are	far	more	attractive	than	others.

Here	 are	 a	 couple	 unfortunate	 truths.	 The	 first	 is	 that	 appearance	 is	 extremely
important.	 The	 difference	 between	 being	 perceived	 as	 stylish	 and	 unstylish	 is
night	 and	 day.	 Yes,	 you	 can	 still	 be	 dressed	 like	 a	 bum	 and	 get	 girls,	 but	 the
difference	 in	 the	 effort-to-reward	 ratio	 is	 massive.	 A	 makeover	 and	 wardrobe
change	 can	 make	 meeting	 and	 dating	 women	 three	 times	 easier	 literally
overnight.	Not	to	mention	all	of	the	psychological	side	benefits	of	making	you
feel	more	confident,	more	interesting,	more	excited,	etc.

Remember,	your	outward	appearance	is	a	reflection	of	your	self-investment	(or
lack	 thereof).	 And	 your	 level	 of	 self-investment	 will	 make	 you	 less	 needy
towards	others,	therefore	making	your	behavior	more	attractive.	If	you	don’t	put
a	lot	of	time	and	effort	into	how	you	look	and	how	you	present	yourself	to	the
world,	women	look	at	that	and	make	unconscious	assumptions	about	your	status

as	a	man.

The	 first	 and	 obvious	 step	 involves	 grooming	 and	 general	 maintenance.	 That
means	regular	showering,	shaving	and	haircuts,	wearing	deodorant,	brushing	and
flossing	your	teeth,	keeping	clean	fingernails,	and	wearing	clean	clothes.

I	should	not	have	to	be	telling	you	this	stuff,	but	just	in	case	I	do,	there	it	is.	The
above	paragraph	is	non-negotiable,	starting	today.

There,	now	let’s	move	on	to	the	two	biggest	factors	on	your	appearance,	the	two
F’s:	Fashion	and	Fitness.

If	these	two	F’s	don’t	excite	you	or	if	your	immediate	thought	is,	“Oh,	I’ll	skip
this	and	go	straight	to	the	pick	up	lines,”	then	I	hate	to	break	it	to	you,	but	things
aren’t	going	to	get	any	easier.	People	are	always	talking	about	what	the	“magic
pill”	to	attraction	is.	If	there	was	such	a	thing	it	would	be	the	two	F’s.	Bar	none,
fitness	 and	 fashion	 will	 do	 more	 to	 attract	 women	 in	 a	 shorter	 amount	 of	 time
than	 anything	 else	 you	 can	 do.	 Being	 in	 decent	 shape	 and	 dressing	 well	 will
make	every	phase	of	the	process	easier	and	smoother,	from	meeting	women,	to
attracting	 them,	 to	 getting	 physical	 with	 them,	 to	 dating	 them,	 to	 staying	 in	 a
relationship	with	them.	There	literally	is	no	downside	to	either	one.

So	 listen	 up	 and	 make	 a	 serious	 commitment	 to	 yourself,	 because	 if	 you	 don’t
make	a	commitment	to	yourself	then	nobody	else	will.

Fashion	and	Fitness

Many	 straight	 guys	 are	 averse	 to	 exploring	 their	 style	 and	 how	 they	 dress
because	they	think	it’s	“gay”	or	intrudes	on	their	masculinity.	It	makes	most	men
feel	uncomfortable.	A	lot	of	men	feel	set	in	their	ways	and	don’t	like	the	idea	of
changing	the	type	of	shirts	they	wear,	or	the	haircut	they’ve	sported	for	years	and
years.	They're	also	intimidated	at	the	idea	of	standing	out	or	looking	too	different
from	the	people	they	hang	around.

If	 this	 describes	 you,	 then	 it	 is	 going	 to	 be	 a	 mental	 hurdle	 that	 you’ll	 have	 to
overcome.	Recognize	that	unless	you’ve	spent	a	large	amount	of	time	focusing
on	fashion	and	style	already,	chances	are	what	you	think	looks	good	right	now	is
not	accurate	at	all.	You	may	think	you	dress	well	—	hell,	everyone	assumes	they
dress	well	before	they	know	better	—	but	really	it’s	likely	that	you	don’t.

So	the	first	step	is	recognizing	what	you	don’t	know.

There	are	a	few	rules	to	dressing	well:

1.	Wear	clothes	that	fit.
2.	Wear	clothes	that	match.
3.	Dress	to	your	personality

We’ll	go	through	and	break	each	one	down,	one	by	one:

Clothes	that	fit:	To	start,	the	vast	majority	of	men	don’t	wear	clothes	that	fit	them
properly.	Men	often	prefer	comfort	and	practicality	to	any	aesthetic	purpose	of
wearing	clothing,	so	most	of	their	clothing	is	too	big.	Chances	are	most	of	your
clothing	right	now	is	too	big.	Many	men	are	also	self-conscious	about	their	body,
so	they	buy	large	clothing	to	mask	it.

When	it	comes	to	clothing,	fit	is	king.	You	can	have	the	nicest,	most	expensive
clothes	in	the	world,	but	if	they	don’t	fit	well	you’ll	look	like	a	clown.	On	the
other	hand,	you	can	have	some	modest	or	even	mediocre	clothing,	but	if	it	fits
well	(and	you’re	in	decent	shape),	you’ll	look	quite	good.

Fit	makes	a	massive	difference	and	the	change	is	immediately	apparent:

The	first	step	to	overhauling	your	wardrobe	should	be	to	go	through	your	closet
and	pull	out	anything	and	everything	that	does	not	fit	well.

You	should	always	know	your	measurements.	If	you’re	not	quite	sure,	ask	to	get
measured.	 Most	 clothing	 department	 stores	 have	 a	 tailor	 who	 will	 gladly	 take
your	measurements	for	you.

With	shirts,	the	shoulder	seam	should	extend	to	the	end	of	the	shoulder,	not	any
further.	If	it	extends	past	the	end	of	your	shoulder,	then	the	shirt	is	too	big.

On	dress	shirts,	the	cuffs	should	not	extend	past	the	wrist	bone.

The	 bottom	 of	 your	 pants	 or	 jeans	 should	 rest	 gently	 on	 the	 top	 of	 your	 shoes
(unless	you	have	a	specific	style	of	rocker	or	hip	hop	jeans).	There	should	not	be
more	 than	 one	 “break”	 in	 your	 jeans	 —	 a	 break	 is	 a	 natural	 fold	 from	 them
resting	on	the	top	of	your	shoe.

If	you’re	stepping	on	the	back	of	your	pants	with	the	heel	of	your	shoe,	they’re
too	 long.	 If	 your	 jeans	 are	 raising	 up	 to	 expose	 your	 socks	 when	 you	 walk,
they’re	too	short.

Your	pants	should	never	sag	from	your	waist	when	you	wear	them,	even	when
leaning	or	bending	over.	Plumber’s	cracks	are	never	attractive.

Jeans	should	also	never	slip	off	your	waist	without	a	belt.	Most	men	wear	jeans
that	 are	 too	 large	 for	 them	 and	 feel	 awkward	 when	 they	 first	 put	 on	 a	 proper-
fitting	 pair	 of	 jeans.	 They	 feel	 tight	 and	 uncomfortable	 at	 first.	 But	 this	 is
normal.	You’ll	get	used	to	them	in	time.

Here’s	an	example	of	jeans	that	don’t	fit:

And	an	example	of	jeans	and	T-shirt	that	fit	well:

A	blazer	that’s	too	big;	notice	the	shoulder	seams	sagging	off	the	sides:

And	another	outfit	that	fits	very	well:

Matching:	 Men	 have	 an	 unbelievable	 knack	 for	 being	 oblivious	 to	 colors	 and
how	to	coordinate	them.

Matching	is	actually	simple	once	you	know	what	to	look	for:

-	Your	belt	should	match	your	shoes	and/or	your	accessories.
-	If	you’re	wearing	dress	pants,	your	socks	should	match	your	pants.
-	If	you’re	wearing	jeans,	your	socks	should	match	your	shoes.
-	Your	accessories	must	all	be	gold	or	all	silver.

Here’s	 an	 easy	 way	 to	 get	 started.	 Go	 out	 and	 buy	 a	 “black	 set”	 and	 a	 “brown
set.”	Buy	a	nice	pair	of	black	shoes,	a	nice	black	belt,	and	a	black	jacket.	Then
buy	a	nice	pair	of	brown	shoes,	a	brown	belt,	and	a	brown	jacket.

Then	buy	a	few	pairs	of	nice	designer	jeans	with	lighter	and	darker	washes	and	a
dozen	or	so	shirts.

Then,	it’s	just	mix-and-match.

You	pick	a	pair	of	jeans,	a	nice	shirt,	and	then	throw	on	your	“brown	set”	or	your
“black	 set”—	 whichever	 set	 compliments	 the	 shirt	 and	 jeans	 the	 best.	 I	 like	 to
wear	 the	 brown	 set	 with	 lighter	 shirts	 and	 jeans,	 and	 the	 black	 set	 with	 darker
shirts	and	jeans.

Of	course,	dressing	gets	more	complicated	than	this,	but	this	is	an	easy	and	fail-
safe	way	to	start	out.

Dress	to	your	personality:	Many	men	learn	about	fashion	and	then	decide	to	buy
some	 ridiculous	 stuff	 that	 does	 not	 suit	 their	 lifestyle	 at	 all:	 a	 40-year-old
business	executive	with	baggy	jeans	and	a	hoodie,	a	20-year-old	college	student
with	a	$500	suit	and	sweater	vest,	or	just	all	kinds	of	random	stuff	—	LED	light
belts,	 gold	 clock	 necklaces,	 top	 hats,	 etc.	 It’s	 amazing	 sometimes	 what	 people
think	is	being	stylish	when	it’s	really	being	outlandish.

You	are	not	stylish	if	you	are	not	dressing	to	your	personality.

There	are	various	fashion-based	stereotypes	considered	attractive	by	women	that
you	 can	 model	 your	 own	 style	 after:	 the	 skater/surfer	 look,	 the	 successful
businessman	look,	the	rock	star	look,	the	athletic	look,	etc.

For	instance,	if	dressing	like	a	rock	musician	fits	your	personality,	then	do	it.	If
you’re	a	top	accounting	executive,	you	should	dress	like	a	stylish	and	successful
businessman.	 If	 you	 love	 hip-hop	 and	 DJ,	 then	 you	 should	 dress	 more	 along
those	lines.

Look	 through	 magazines	 and	 get	 on	 the	 internet.	 Find	 famous	 people	 or	 role
models	who	represent	your	personality.	Then	model	yourself	after	those	people’s
appearance.

Finally,	 if	 you’re	 struggling	 to	 get	 a	 jump-start	 on	 fashion,	 you	 can	 get	 a
fashionable	female	friend	to	take	you	shopping.

Good	female	friends	are	good	assets	if	you’re	clueless	about	shopping,	sizes,	and
what	looks	good	on	you.	They	can	educate	you	and	give	you	an	unbiased	female
opinion	on	what	looks	hot	on	you	and	what	doesn’t.

But	 be	 warned,	 just	 because	 they	 have	 a	 vagina	 doesn’t	 make	 them	 a	 de	facto

expert.	Many	women	aren’t	as	knowledgeable	about	fashion	as	they	seem.	Also,
many	women	will	try	to	dress	you	to	their	idea	of	a	hot	guy,	not	necessarily	what
works	best	for	you.

Fitness:	I’m	not	going	to	get	into	the	nitty-gritty	of	fitness	in	this	book	because
there	are	so	many	resources	out	there	already.	But	I’ll	make	a	few	basic	points.

1.	Exercise,	no	matter	what.	This	is	not	negotiable.	Beyond	simply	making
you	 look	 better	 naked,	 exercise	 boosts	 your	 energy,	 raises	 testosterone,
relieves	symptoms	of	depression	and	anxiety,	and	generally	makes	you	feel
better	about	yourself.

The	exact	way	that	you	exercise	isn’t	as	important	as	the	fact	that	you	do	it.
If	you	like	to	play	soccer,	then	find	people	to	play	soccer	with.	If	you	like	to
do	 calisthenics	 and	 yoga,	 then	 pursue	 that.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 hit	 the	 weight
room	and	get	big,	go	for	that.

2.	Clean	up	your	diet.	An	easy	starting	point	that	will	give	you	80%	of	the
results	 for	 20%	 of	 the	 effort	 is	 simply	 cutting	 out	 the	 following	 things:
sodas,	fast	food,	desserts,	and	candy.	If	you	just	cut	those	things	out	of	your
diet,	you’ll	see	a	drastic	improvement.

There’s	a	lot	of	info	out	there	on	low-carb,	high-carb,	high-protein,	low-fat,
and	 so	 on	 and	 so	 on.	 Nutrition	 information	 is	 a	 sea	 that	 you	 can	 easily
drown	yourself	in.

But	if	you	start	with	the	most	fundamental	basics	and	cut	the	above	things
out	 of	 your	 diet	 (and	 start	 exercising	 regularly),	 it’s	 impossible	 to	 not	 see
major	benefits	within	a	few	months.

And	again,	similar	to	exercise,	nutrition	goes	beyond	making	you	look	sexy.
It	 makes	 you	 feel	 better,	 gives	 you	 higher	 energy,	 makes	 your	 sex	 better,
increases	your	moods,	and	can	even	save	you	a	lot	of	money.

Body	Language

Body	language	is	something	that	can	also	be	fixed	in	a	relatively	short	amount	of
time	and	can	immediately	make	you	appear	more	attractive.

Some	 studies	 claim	 that	 body	 language	 accounts	 for	 as	 much	 of	 60%	 of	 all
communication	that	occurs	between	two	people.	That’s	a	lot.

Considering	all	of	the	discussion	we’ve	had	about	neediness,	intention,	and	sub-
communication	in	the	beginning	of	the	book,	the	importance	of	body	language
shouldn’t	surprise	you.

Major	body	language	problems	can	be	addressed	consciously	and	with	practice.
But	your	body	language	will	continue	to	improve	as	a	side	effect	of	becoming
less	needy	and	getting	plenty	of	exercise.

To	 analyze	 your	 posture	 in	 this	 section,	 you	 will	 need	 the	 help	 of	 a	 mirror
(preferably	full-body).

1.	 Start	 by	 facing	 the	 mirror	 and	 then	 turn	 90	 degrees	 to	 the	 right	 or	 left.
You	should	have	a	perfect	“side	view”	of	yourself.	Now	look	at	the	“ridge”
that	extends	from	your	neck	to	the	end	of	your	shoulder.	If	you’re	wearing	a
shirt,	 look	 at	 the	 seam	 that	 extends	 from	 your	 neck	 to	 your	 sleeve.	 That
seam	 or	 ridge	 on	 almost	 everyone	 will	 be	 slanted	 forward.	 Move	 your
shoulders	 back	 until	 that	 ridge	 or	 seam	 is	 straight	 —	 going	 straight	 from
your	neck	to	your	shoulder.	That’s	the	optimal	position	for	your	shoulders.
Remember	that	position	and	remind	yourself	to	hold	your	shoulders	there	as
often	as	possible.

2.	 Next,	 turn	 and	 look	 directly	 into	 the	 mirror,	 with	 your	 shoulders	 back,
raise	your	chin	up	until	it’s	at	a	90-degree	angle	with	your	neck.	Your	eyes
should	be	looking	dead-ahead	now,	straight	into	themselves	in	the	mirror,	or
aiming	 straight	 at	 the	 horizon	 as	 if	 you	 were	 walking.	 Make	 the	 back	 of
your	neck	as	straight	as	possible	with	your	back.	Notice	when	you	pull	your
head	up	like	this	with	your	shoulders	back,	your	stomach	naturally	comes
in,	and	your	back	naturally	straightens	up.	This	is	what	we	want!

3.	Next,	look	at	your	feet.	They	should	be	shoulder-width	apart.	Take	note
of	which	way	your	feet	are	pointing.	They	should	be	pointed	straight	ahead
or	 slightly	 outward	 at	 the	 most.	 If	 they’re	 pointed	 inward	 or	 very	 far
outward,	this	will	cause	posture	problems	and	make	you	walk	funny.	Turn
them	straight	ahead	or	at	a	slight	outward	angle	and	hold	them	there.	If	they
continue	 to	 point	 in	 or	 out	 (especially	 when	 you	 sit	 down),	 it	 means	 that
your	calf	muscles	are	too	tight,	and	you	need	to	stretch	them	or	roll	them

with	a	foam	roller.

4.	 Now,	 it’s	 time	 to	 walk.	 Hold	 the	 position	 you’re	 in	 —	 shoulders	 back,
head	up,	back	straight,	stomach	in,	feet	straight	—	and	then	slowly	step	in
front	of	you.	As	you	walk,	you	want	to	swing	your	shoulders.	Not	too	far,
because	that’ll	make	you	look	ridiculous,	but	move	your	shoulders	as	you
walk.	 This	 will	 create	 swagger	 and	 make	 you	 look	 more	 relaxed	 as	 you
walk.	It	will	probably	feel	weird	looking	straight	up	and	ahead	while	you’re
walking,	but	this	is	good.	You	want	to	be	able	to	look	everybody	in	the	eye
as	you	walk	by	them.

5.	 Finally,	 swing	 your	 arms	 slightly.	 If	 you	 don’t	 swing	 them,	 you	 look
robotic.	If	you	have	them	in	your	pockets,	you’re	either	cold	or	a	pussy.	If
you	 swing	 them	 too	 far,	 you	 look	 ridiculous.	 Just	 give	 them	 a	 slight
swing…	to	go	along	with	your	swagger.	There.

Practice	this	a	few	times	until	you	can	remember	how	it	feels.	Take	note	of	the
feeling	and	then	force	yourself	to	go	back	to	this	position	as	much	as	possible.

Go	step-by-step	if	you	must.	As	you	walk	down	the	street,	remember:	shoulders
back,	 chin	 up,	 eyes	 straight,	 feet	 straight,	 shoulders	 swagger,	 arms	 swing.
Always	 look	 straight	 ahead.	 Don’t	 ever	 look	 down	 at	 the	 ground	 unless	 you
think	you’re	about	to	trip.	Look	people	in	the	eye	as	they	walk	by	—	particularly
attractive	girls.	You’ll	catch	people	making	eye	contact	with	you.	You’ll	feel	the
urge	to	look	away.	Don’t.	Always	make	other	people	break	eye	contact	with	you
before	you	break	it	with	them.

Do	it	until	it	becomes	a	habit.

Challenge	yourself	to	go	out	for	a	week	straight	and	do	this	every	time	you’re	in
public.	 Notice	 any	 changes	 in	 how	 you	 feel.	 Notice	 any	 shifts	 in	 people’s
reactions	to	you.	Notice	any	shifts	in	your	confidence.

Vocal	Tonality

Vocal	tonality	is	definitely	overlooked	by	men.	It’s	not	just	having	a	sexy	voice
that’s	important;	it’s	having	an	expressive	and	a	loud	voice.

We	 actually	 have	 two	 “voices”:	 a	 “head”	 voice	 and	 a	 “chest”	 voice.	 Basically,

when	you	sing,	your	head	voice	does	the	high	notes	and	the	chest	voice	does	the
low	 ones.	 Your	 head	 voice	 breathes	 out	 largely	 through	 your	 nose	 while	 your
chest	voice	through	your	mouth.	The	head	voice	comes	from	the	throat	and	the
chest	voice	from	the	diaphragm.

Try	 this	 exercise.	 Hum	 a	 note,	 then	 slowly	 raise	 it	 and	 then	 slowly	 lower	 it.	 It
should	sound	like	a	siren,	up	high,	down	low,	up	high,	down	low.	As	you	do	this,
pay	attention	to	where	the	air	pressure	in	your	body	is.	As	you	shift	from	high	to
low,	it	goes	from	your	head	to	your	chest,	and	then	back	up	again.

As	you	could	guess,	we	want	to	develop	that	chest	voice.	Again,	the	only	way	to
do	 this	 is	 through	 conscious	 practice	 —	 reminding	 yourself	 countless	 times	 to
speak	from	your	chest	voice	until	it	becomes	a	habit.

Here’s	a	cool	exercise	that	you	can	do.	Read	the	following	sentence	aloud:

“Do	you	want	to	get	a	drink	Thursday	night?”

Now,	hold	your	nose	and	read	it	again.	How	different	is	your	tonality?	If	it’s	not
very	 different,	 you	 already	 speak	 largely	 from	 your	 chest	 and	 probably	 have
good	 tonality.	 If	 you	 suddenly	 sound	 very	 nasal	 when	 you	 hold	 your	 nose	 and
say	it,	you	need	to	work	on	speaking	with	a	deeper	voice.

Keep	 practicing	 it	 until	 you	 can	 say	 it	 while	 holding	 your	 nose	 and	 it	 doesn’t
sound	any	different.

Another	 problem	 men	 have	 is	 they	 often	 talk	 too	 quickly.	 This	 comes	 from	 a
subconscious	 belief	 that	 if	 we	 don’t	 get	 everything	 out	 quickly,	 people	 won’t
listen	to	everything	we	have	to	say.	This	is	a	needy	behavior.

There’s	not	a	definitive	metric	for	this.	But	pay	attention	to	whether	people	seem
to	 have	 trouble	 hearing	 you	 often.	 Experiment	 with	 slowing	 down	 how	 you
speak	and	notice	any	differences	in	how	it	feels	or	reactions	you	get.	If	people
are	constantly	asking	you	to	repeat	yourself,	and	it’s	not	loud	in	the	room,	you
may	speak	too	quickly.

Also,	chances	are	you	are	not	loud	enough.	In	fact,	just	about	everyone	does	not
speak	 loud	 enough.	 Speak	 louder.	 Do	 it	 now,	 do	 it	 everywhere.	 Don’t	 scream.
But	speak	loudly,	from	the	diaphragm,	from	your	chest	voice.	Research	shows	it
commands	more	respect	and	attention.

Like	body	language,	these	adjustments	will	take	time	and	practice	to	implement.

Not	only	do	better	body	language	and	vocal	projection	engage	other	people	more
effectively,	but	good	body	language	has	also	been	shown	to	affect	your	 moods
positively.	 Yes,	 even	 shifting	 your	 body	 into	 a	 more	 confident	 position
consciously	will	make	you	feel	more	confident	and	vice-versa.	Even	if	you	do	it
on	 purpose	 and	 know	 what	 you’re	 doing,	 it	 will	 still	 work.	 So	 start	 paying
attention	to	your	body,	how	you	present	yourself,	how	you	sit,	how	you	stand,
and	the	amount	of	eye	contact	you’re	making.	It	makes	a	difference.	And	it	adds
up	quickly.

Developing	Character

One	 thing	 that	 consistently	 holds	 men	 back	 is	 that	 they	 come	 across	 as	 just
another	typical	dude	or	bro.	Dime	a	dozen.	We’re	pressured	most	of	our	lives	to
go	with	the	flow,	go	along	with	what	our	friends	like	and	just	agree	with	what
those	around	us	think.

As	we’ve	discussed,	this	is	unattractive	behavior	because	it	demonstrates	a	lack
of	 investment	 in	 your	 own	 interests,	 passions,	 and	 desires.	 Attractive	 men	 are
polarizing	and	uninhibited.	Attractive	men	make	their	opinions	known.	They’ve
had	 unique	 experiences	 and	 ideas.	 They’ve	 tried	 things	 many	 people	 haven’t
tried,	 done	 things	 many	 people	 haven’t	 done,	 and	 share	 their	 ideas	 openly	 and
freely.

Put	another	way,	an	attractive	man	with	depth	and	character	 is	a	man	who	has
opinions	and	openly	expresses	those	opinions.

When	it	comes	to	deciding	what	one	likes	and	doesn’t	like,	most	men	have	very
lukewarm	reactions	one	way	or	the	other.

“Yeah,	 that	 movie’s	 awesome,”	 or	 “Yeah,	 I	 like	 that	 one,”	 or	 “No,	 I	 don’t	 like
that	show.”	It	rarely	goes	beyond	that.	There’s	no	sharing	of	why	one	prefers	one
type	 of	 music	 over	 another,	 one	 movie	 over	 another,	 one	 author	 over	 another.
And	there’s	no	connection	to	the	emotions	driving	that	preference.

For	 instance,	 a	 random	 Joe	 may	 say,	 “I	 really	 liked	 Terminator.	 It	 was	 pretty
cool.”

A	 more	 interesting	 person	 may	 say,	 “Terminator	 was	 great.	 But	 what’s	 more
interesting	 to	 me	 is	 that	 it	 was	 the	 first	 movie	 I	 can	 remember	 in	 which	 you
ended	up	rooting	for	the	villain.”

There’s	 nothing	 wrong	 with	 being	 amiable	 and	 enjoying	 similar	 things	 to	 your
friends.	 But	 one	 thing	 that	 will	 always	 make	 you	 stand	 out,	 particularly	 to
women,	 is	 if	 you’ve	 not	 only	 expanded	 your	 horizons,	 but	 you’ve	 also	 made
your	own	decisions	about	your	personal	tastes,	your	experiences,	and	what	you
think	about	various	topics.

Let’s	be	real,	out	of	10	men	the	typical	single	woman	meets,	9	of	them	are	into
the	 following	 things:	 sports,	 comedy	 movies,	 rock	 and/or	 hip-hop	 music,	 and
other	generic	guy	activities.	Again,	nothing	wrong	with	this,	but	what’s	going	to
make	you	stick	out?

We	 want	 to	 shape	 you	 into	 a	 man	 with	 taste,	 a	 man	 with	 opinions,	 and	 a	 man
who	can	explain	exactly	why	he	likes	or	dislikes	everything	from	70s	Motown
records	 to	 German	 films	 to	 19th-century	 literature	 to	 impressionistic	 art.	 Don’t
get	 me	 wrong,	 I’m	 not	 about	 to	 tell	 you	 to	 go	 take	 a	 bunch	 of	 art	 classes	 or
whatever.	 You	 don’t	 need	 to	 be	 a	 super-intellectual	 snob.	 This	 is	 about
developing	your	own	opinions	and	enriching	your	life.

Too	many	men	let	 their	opinions	be	dictated	by	pop	culture	and	their	group	of
guy	friends.

“Oh	dude,	Will	Farrell	is	soooo	funny.”
“The	new	Batman	movie	is	awesome.”

Few	 men	 ever	 stop	 and	 actually	 think	 critically	 about	 why	 they	 like	 certain
things,	why	certain	forms	of	pop	culture	are	popular	and	others	are	not.	Few	have
the	curiosity	to	look	into	new	art	forms	or	hobbies	and	figure	out	how	they	feel
about	them.

Here	 are	 some	 concepts	 to	 keep	 in	 mind	 as	 you	 go	 through	 your	 life
experiencing	art	and	media:

1.	Assume	everything	has	a	form	of	value;	it’s	your	job	to	find	it.
Nothing	 is	 stupider	 than	 to	 be	 prejudiced	 against	 a	 genre	 of	 music	 or	 type	 of
movie	 for	 no	 other	 reason	 than	 because	 of	 some	 stereotype	 or	 preconceived
notion	about	it.

Drop	all	of	this	prejudice	and	adopt	this	mentality	immediately:	“there	has	to	be
something	to	this	form	of	art,	otherwise	it	wouldn’t	have	a	following,	so	I	should
find	out	what	that	something	is.”	Once	you	find	it,	then	decide	if	you	like	it	or
not.	Whether	you	like	something	or	not,	you	should	always	be	able	to	appreciate
it.

2.	 When	 expanding	 your	 horizons;	 start	 with	 what’s	 generally	 considered	 the
best.

Some	forms	of	art	will	come	easily	and	naturally	to	you.	It	takes	me	literally	two
seconds	 to	 identify	 rock	 music	 that	 is	 transcendentally	 good,	 or	 painfully	 bad.
I’ve	 been	 listening	 to	 it	 all	 my	 life.	 Country?	 Classical?	 Bluegrass?	 That	 takes
some	more	time.

Do	the	same	with	movies.	Watch	every	movie	in	IMDB’s	list	of	top	20	movies
of	all	time.	Google	critics’	top	10	movies	of	all	time	lists	and	watch	everything
on	there.	Watch	every	movie	that’s	ever	won	an	Oscar	for	“Best	Picture.”	That’s
a	good	start.

Now,	you	may	be	saying	to	yourself:	“This	is	all	nice,	but	reading	Hemingway
or	developing	opinions	on	Chaucer	or	Bach	will	never	get	me	laid.”

Well,	touché.	Although,	I’ll	make	the	following	points:

1.	 Being	 a	 well-rounded	 individual	 with	 opinions	 will	 expand	 your
demographics	by	quite	a	bit.	So	yes,	none	of	this	is	necessary	if	you	want	to
date	a	woman	who	has	no	interesting	opinions	herself.	But	if	you	want	to
date	 brilliant,	 vivacious	 women	 with	 artistic	 sensibility,	 passion	 and	 class,
then	a	lot	of	this	is	a	prerequisite.

2.	 The	 second	 point	 I’ll	 make	 is	 what	 my	 high	 school	 literature	 teacher
always	 told	 us:	 “You	 read	 literature	 because	 you	 can	 never	 meet	 enough
people.”	What	I	take	from	this	is	yes,	even	though	reading	Hemingway	or
Milton	Friedman’s	economic	theories	may	not	directly	get	you	laid,	what	it
will	do	is	develop	your	perspective	to	be	more	varied,	allow	you	to	be	able
to	relate	to	more	people’s	experiences	and	ideas,	and	generally	have	a	wider
body	of	knowledge	for	dealing	with	people	in	general.

Believe	 it	 or	 not,	 Hayek’s	 economic	 arguments	 for	 libertarianism	 have
influenced	my	perspectives	on	dating	and	relationships	for	the	better.	I	know	that

may	sound	crazy,	but	it’s	true.

Anyone	 who	 has	 read	 a	 lot	 can	 tell	 you	 that	 the	 best	 ideas	 you	 take	 from	 a
certain	book	often	have	nothing	to	do	with	the	book	you	read.

Many	 men	 have	 been	 caged	 into	 the	 same	 day-to-day	 grind,	 wasting	 away,
spending	 their	 life	 doing	 things	 they	 don’t	 truly	 enjoy	 and	 that	 don’t	 truly
express	their	identity	and	personality.

-	They	go	to	work	(often	at	a	good	job).
-	They	come	home	and	unwind.
-	They	watch	the	typical	sports/sitcoms/movies.
-	On	Fridays/Saturdays,	they	hang	out	with	the	same	3-4	friends.

Often	I	meet	men	who	don’t	even	have	this	much	variability	and	balance	in	their
lives.	They’re	stuck	in	60-to-80-hour-per-week	jobs,	or	they	work	two	jobs,	they
have	absolute	no	hobbies	outside	their	filling	bank	account.

Now,	there’s	nothing	“wrong”	with	the	above	list.	It	represents	about	90%	of	the
male	population	between	the	ages	of	20	and	40	in	the	western	world.

But	again,	that’s	the	point:	how	are	you	going	to	differentiate	yourself	from	the
other	90%	of	men	out	there?

Ask	yourself	this:	If	you	were	lined	up	next	to	10	random,	single	men	from	your
town,	what	would	make	you	stand	out	from	them?	Imagine	a	woman	met	all	10
of	you	in	a	row.	What	is	there	about	you	that	would	stop	her	dead	in	her	tracks
and	 make	 her	 say,	 "Wow,	 this	 man	 is	 unique?"	 What	 do	 you	 have	 that	 they
don’t?	What	can	you	offer	that	most	other	men	can’t?

Do	you	secretly	write	poetry	in	your	spare	time	and	hide	it	in	your	closet?	Have
you	been	skydiving	three	times?	Did	you	climb	a	glacier	in	the	Alps	once?	Have
you	tried	eating	things	like	snakes,	worms,	spiders?	What	have	you	done	that’s
cool	and	interesting	and	has	shaped	you	as	a	person?

What	are	your	rough	edges	that	people	can’t	find	anywhere	else?	What	have	you
done	that	will	make	you	stand	out	in	her	mind?

Bringing	It	All	Together

Developing	an	attractive	lifestyle	is	a	long-term	process.	It	requires	a	consistent
and	penetrating	look	at	your	actions,	your	habits	and	what	you’ve	chosen	to	do
with	most	of	your	time.

Your	 job,	 your	 hobbies,	 your	 friends,	 your	 interests,	 are	 these	 things	 mostly	 a
result	 of	 what	 was	 told	 to	 you	 or	 pushed	 on	 you,	 or	 are	 they	 things	 that	 you
consciously	 evaluated	 and	 chose	 based	 on	 how	 enriching	 and	 passionate	 they
made	you	feel?

These	are	important	questions.	No	one	can	live	your	life	but	you.	And	as	long	as
you	 sleepwalk	 through	 life	 not	 ever	 questioning	 or	 evaluating	 the	 lifestyle
you’ve	built	for	yourself,	the	same	behavioral	patterns	are	likely	to	creep	up	over
and	over	again.

Men	often	don’t	totally	believe	me,	but	poor	lifestyle	choices	afflict	all	of	your
interactions	and	communication	when	it	comes	to	women.	Poor	lifestyle	choices
reflect	 a	 lack	 of	 investment	 in	 yourself,	 which	 in	 turn	 causes	 you	 to	 be	 less
confident	around	others	for	validation.

I	 first	 noticed	 this	 when	 I	 worked	 with	 men	 who	 still	 lived	 at	 home	 with	 their
parents.	A	lot	of	these	men	were	great	guys.	They	were	smart,	funny,	caring,	had
interesting	hobbies.	Some	even	had	a	good	job,	but	they	stayed	with	their	parents
for	other	reasons	(health,	etc.)

Yet	they	got	absolutely	no	results.	Women	never	responded	warmly	to	them,	and
they	never	seemed	quite	as	motivated	or	as	confident.

There’s	 a	 certain	 baseline	 level	 of	 independence	 and	 self-sufficiency	 that	 your
lifestyle	must	give	you	for	you	to	be	able	to	move	forward.	If	you’re	constantly
stressed	by	work,	upset	by	your	friends,	and	in	poor	health,	then	no	amount	of
work	 on	 your	 anxieties	 and	 communication	 is	 going	 to	 help	 much.	 You’re
effectively	 putting	 a	 ceiling	 on	 your	 development	 and	 your	 potential	 with
women.	The	other	two	parts	of	this	book	will	not	be	much	use	to	you.	You	can
try,	but	I	can	tell	you,	you	probably	won’t	see	much	change	in	your	results.

Get	your	life	taken	care	of.	Get	healthy.	Find	a	happy	group	of	friends.	Find	a
few	hobbies	that	you	love.	Develop	opinions.	Start	caring	about	what	you	spend
your	 time	 doing.	 This	 increases	 your	 self-investment	 and	 will	 make	 you	 less
needy	around	others.	This,	in	turn,	will	give	you	the	courage	to	take	the	correct
action	and	the	wherewithal	to	communicate	effectively.	This	is	honest	living.

And	once	you’re	living	a	life	true	to	yourself,	your	values	and	your	ideals,	then
it’s	time	to	take	action.

Part	IV:	Honest	Action

Chapter	9:
What	Are	Your	Stories?

I	park	my	car	in	front	of	the	gym	and	immediately	pop	my	headphones	into	my
ears.	As	I	get	out	and	walk	across	the	parking	lot,	I	catch	a	glimpse	of	a	slender
figure	walking	toward	the	door	from	another	angle.	I	look	over.	She’s	hot.

We	catch	eyes	and	hold.	She	looks	away,	but	only	after	holding	my	gaze	for	a
half-second	longer	than	most	people	would.	An	instant	of	sexual	tension	pops	up
between	us.

She	walks	into	the	gym	about	ten	paces	ahead	of	me.	I	check	out	her	ass.	It	says
“PINK.”	 It’s	 those	 fuzzy	 kind	 of	 tight	 sweat	 suits	 girls	 wear	 sometimes.	 My
mind	 immediately	 judges	 this.	 For	 some	 reason,	 I	 think	 she’s	 trashy.	 I	 have	 to
stop	myself.	What	do	I	know?	Nothing.

For	a	moment,	we’re	at	the	sign-in	desk	next	to	one	another.	I	start	scanning	in
my	mind	for	something	to	say	to	her.	But	before	I	can	settle	on	something	her
phone	rings	and	she	answers	it.	“Oh	god,	one	of	those	girls,”	I	instinctively	say
to	myself.	Again	I	have	to	stop	myself.	I	don’t	know	her.	But	obviously,	if	I’m
dedicating	such	mental	energy	to	her,	I	probably	should.

For	 a	few	seconds	in	my	head,	I	toy	 with	some	logistical	scenarios	that	would
allow	me	to	talk	to	her	later	—	like	pretend	I	have	to	go	to	the	bathroom	so	I	can
come	 back	 and	 hopefully	 catch	 her	 off	 her	 phone.	 No,	 that’s	 too	 contrived.	 I
could	just	approach	her	in	the	gym	while	we’re	working	out.	But	to	be	honest,
that	has	never	gone	well	for	me	in	the	past	and	I’m	here	to	work	out,	not	to	make
friends.	Or	maybe	I	do	my	workout	and	try	to	time	it	so	that	I’m	leaving	when
she	is.	Then	I	would	feel	like	a	stalker.	Theoretically,	these	things	could	work,
but	 my	 mind’s	 losing	 interest.	 My	 headphones	 are	 blaring	 and	 my	 mind	 is
working	its	way	towards	the	squat	rack.

I’m	not	going	to	lie	and	say	that	despite	all	of	my	hedging	and	indifference	that	I
magically	 came	 up	 with	 some	 miraculous	 line	 that	 saved	 the	 day.	 Because	 I
didn’t	talk	to	her.	In	fact,	I	don’t	remember	seeing	her	again	or	thinking	of	her
until	 I	 wrote	 this.	 So	 I	 didn’t	 save	 the	 day.	 But	 then	 again	 there	 was	 nothing
wrong	with	my	day	and	there	still	isn’t.

I’m	 also	 not	 going	 to	 sit	 here,	 as	 is	 typical	 with	 these	 types	 of	 books,	 and
chastise	myself	for	bitching	out,	for	being	a	pussy,	and	for	not	manning	up.	It’s
not	that	big	of	a	deal.	And	I’m	also	not	going	to	give	you,	my	humble	reader,	yet
another	 lecture	 on	 how	 you	 should	 never	 bitch	 out,	 how	 you	 should	 always,
always,	always	talk	to	her,	no	matter	what,	you	fucking	pussy	—	even	if	she’s	at
the	gym,	on	the	phone,	juggling	knives,	doing	a	handstand,	changing	a	flat	tire	or
administering	CPR	—	you	always	fucking	chat	her	up,	goddamnit.

Let’s	be	honest,	we	all	pass	up	dozens	of	situations	like	the	above	on	a	weekly
basis,	 no	 matter	 how	 experienced	 or	 inexperienced	 we	 are.	 We’ve	 all	 let
hundreds,	if	not	thousands	of	opportunities	go,	usually	without	a	thought	or	even
realizing	it.	We’ve	all	done	it.	And	we’ll	all	continue	to	do	it.

So	 I’m	 not	 here	 to	 rail	 on	 you	 to	 stop	 passing	 up	 opportunities.	 You	 already
know	the	opportunities	you	pass	up.	And	I’m	sure	by	now	you’ve	had	more	than
your	fill	of	woulda-coulda-shoulda	moments.

I’m	 more	 interested	 in	 the	 stories	 you	 tell	 yourself.	 The	 stories	 that	 we	 all	 tell
ourselves.

When	I	got	into	this	stuff	years	ago,	I	struggled	with	anxiety	around	women	as
much	as	anyone	as	I’ve	ever	met.	I’ve	coached	hundreds	of	men	since	then,	and
I’ve	 maybe	only	met	3-5	 guys	who	have	 had	worse	 anxiety	than	I	did	when	it
comes	to	walking	up	to	a	random	woman	and	speaking	to	her.

Jump	to	today.	I	rarely	experience	approach	anxiety	consciously	anymore.	That
isn’t	to	say	I’m	some	sort	of	badass.	I	put	in	my	time.	I	paid	my	dues.	A	lot	of	it
was	fun	and	a	lot	of	it	sucked	and	was	humiliating.	But	I	did	it.	I	grew.	And	I’m
a	better	person	for	it	now.	Through	the	basic	rote	exercise	of	meeting	thousands
of	women	in	the	most	basic	or	ridiculous	scenarios	over	the	years,	most	of	that
palpable	fear	—	the	hand	sweating,	the	fast	breathing,	the	mind	going	blank	—
most	of	that	is	gone.

What’s	not	gone,	and	as	far	as	I	can	tell,	what	will	never	be	gone,	is	a	continuing
internal	 resistance	 to	 change,	 whether	 it	 be	 through	 outright	 fear,	 or	 subtle
subconscious	 thoughts	 trying	 to	 sabotage	 me.	 That	 never	 stops.	 I	 don’t	 feel
nervous	anymore,	but	I	do	feel	a	dreadful	judgment	and	boredom.	“Only	prissy
girls	wear	crap	like	that,”	“Oh	God,	she’s	one	of	those	girls	who’s	always	on	her
phone.	 I	 don’t	 have	 time	 for	 this.”	 Sometimes	 it	 happens	 pre-approach.

Sometimes	it	happens	30	minutes	in.	Sometimes	it	happens	on	the	second	date.
But	always,	these	judgments	aren’t	accurate	portrayals	of	her.	I	don’t	even	know
her.	 Yet	 I’m	 judging	 her.	 It’s	 a	 defense	 mechanism.	 My	 conscious	 fear	 has
disappeared,	but	my	subconscious	resistance	is	still	alive	and	kicking.

And	 from	 what	 I’ve	 observed,	 everybody’s	 subconscious	 defense	 mechanisms
are	still	kicking.	The	resistance	doesn’t	go	away.	It	just	changes	shape.	Over	the
years,	anxiety	morphs	into	apathy,	which	morphs	into	arrogance.	The	resistance
may	 come	 before	 meeting	 her	 or	 before	 kissing	 her	 or	 before	 having	 sex	 or
before	committing	to	a	relationship.	We	all	have	our	own	weak	spots,	and	those
weaknesses	each	have	their	own	form	of	resistance	to	the	change	we	want.	One
boundary	simply	gets	pushed	back	into	another	and	another.

Whether	you	feel	incredibly	nervous	before	you	approach,	or	if	you	procrastinate
calling	 women	 you’ve	 met,	 or	 if	 you	 tell	 yourself	 that	 you	 suddenly	 magically
“don’t	feel	like”	having	sex	when	you’re	out	on	a	date	with	a	girl	even	though
she’s	 obviously	 into	 you	 and	 wants	 to	 go	 home	 with	 you,	 this	 is	 your
subconscious	resisting	change.	And	your	mind	is	inventing	stories	to	explain	that
resistance.	 These	 stories	 have	 emotions	 tied	 to	 them,	 whether	 they’re	 fear,
boredom,	anger,	shame,	or	whatever	—	which	contribute	to	keeping	you	in	the
same	place	you	are	right	now.	It’s	your	emotional	inertia.	It’s	the	status	quo.	The
mechanisms	wired	into	you	to	keep	you	there,	safe.	And	we	all	have	them.

Here	are	some	other	stories	I’ve	been	telling	myself	lately:	That	I’m	too	good	for
these	 girls;	 it’s	 my	 subconscious’s	 favorite	 story	 right	 now.	 I	 tell	 myself,	 “I’ve
been	 with	 dozens	 of	 women	 hotter/smarter/cooler	 than	 her,	 so	 why	 should	 I
bother?”	Yes,	I	recognize	myriad	things	that	are	wrong	with	that	thought.	Yes,	I
realize	 I’m	 totally	 pompous	 and	 full	 of	 shit	 when	 I	 think	 that.	 But	 that’s	 my
point.	We’re	all	full	of	shit	—	a	lot.	All	of	our	stories	are.	And	we	listen	to	them
most	of	the	time.	We	believe	them.	I	know	mine’s	dumb,	just	like	yours	probably
is	 too.	 But	 that’s	 what	 pops	 into	 my	 head.	 That’s	 the	 excuse	 I	 have	 to	 fight
through	these	days.	And	for	me,	this	one	is	a	constant	battle.

Another	 one	 that’s	 been	 surfacing	 a	 lot	 is	 that	 I	 don’t	 follow	 up	 by	 phone/text
enough	because	I	feel	like	I’ve	somehow	earned	the	right	to	not	put	effort	into
my	interactions	with	women	anymore	(if	you	ever	wondered	how	teaching	pick
up	and	dating	can	kind	of	screw	you	up,	there’s	a	nice	example).

I	don’t	call	girls	back	as	often	as	I	should.	I	feel	entitled	for	some	reason.	Like

they	should	feel	grateful	and	just	show	up	at	my	doorstep	when	I	want	them	to.
Sure,	 sometimes	 I	 genuinely	 don’t	 really	 dig	 a	 girl	 and	 don’t	 care	 if	 I	 see	 her
again.	 But	 other	 times	 I	 do	 and	 I	 regret	 not	 putting	 in	 the	 extra	 effort	 a	 few
weeks	later.

These	 are	 my	 stories.	 They’re	 completely	 different	 now	 than	 they	 were	 three
years	ago.	And	they	were	completely	different	three	years	ago	than	they	were	six
years	ago.	 But	they’ve	all	had	the	same	purpose:	to	protect	the	 status	 quo.	 My
emotional	inertia.

What	 stories	 do	 you	 tell	 yourself?	 Because	 until	 you’re	 aware	 of	 your	 stories,
you’re	 not	 going	 to	 be	 able	 to	 change	 your	 behavior.	 Maybe	 you	 get	 very
nervous	in	bars	and	clubs	and	tell	yourself	stories	of	inadequacy.	“Girls	like	that
only	 like	 tall	 guys	 with	 muscles.”	 Or	 maybe	 you	 tell	 yourself,	 “I’ll	 start
approaching	after	a	few	drinks.”	Or	maybe	you	tell	yourself	that	you’re	always
in	too	much	of	a	hurry,	too	busy	 to	stop	 and	say	 hello	to	a	woman	in	a	 coffee
shop.

Maybe	you	tell	yourself	that	you	need	to	have	something	really	amazing	to	say
for	 her	 to	 like	 you.	 So	 you	 stutter	 and	 stumble	 when	 talking	 to	 her,	 trying	 too
hard	 and	 weirding	 her	 out.	 Here’s	 a	 story	 to	 try	 out:	 maybe	 you’re	 already
amazing.

Or	 how	 about	 this	 one?	 Maybe	 you	 tell	 yourself	 that	 you’re	 not	 even	 ready	 to
meet	women	yet.	You	sit	at	home	and	read	more	books	like	this,	telling	yourself
“Just	a	little	bit	more,”	or	“After	I	get	a	raise	and	a	new	haircut,”	or	“Once	I	save
up	 to	 buy	 some	 nice	 clothes.”	 And	 then	 once	 you	 get	 that	 raise,	 or	 get	 those
clothes,	then	a	new	story	pops	up	to	take	its	place.	You	need	to	study	more	first.
Or	go	on	a	diet.	Then	you’ll	be	ready.	Yet	six	months	have	gone	by,	and	nothing.

It’s	 always	 something,	 isn’t	 it?	 There	 always	 seems	 to	 be	 something	 that	 you
don’t	have	right	this	second,	that	if	you	had	it,	you’d	be	able	to	act	in	the	exact
way	that	you’d	like.	Right?

So	 what	 are	 your	 stories?	 What	 do	 you	 tell	 yourself	 to	 justify	 that	 internal
resistance	inside	you?	And	what	stories	can	you	tell	yourself	instead	to	remove
as	much	of	that	resistance	as	possible?

People	talk	a	lot	about	the	idea	of	“skill”	in	all	of	this	stuff.	“Pick	up	is	a	skill.	It
needs	 to	 be	 practiced,”	 blah,	 blah,	 blah.	 I	 think	 as	 the	 years	 go	 on,	 it’s	 being

proven	 over	 and	 over	 that	 what	 you	 say	 isn’t	 so	 important,	 how	 you	 approach
isn’t	 so	 important.	 What’s	 important	 is	 that	 you	 move	 things	 forward	 without
hesitation,	 without	 that	 resistance	 that	 you’re	 obeying	 right	 now	 by	 doing
nothing,	by	remaining	in	the	status	quo	—	the	same	resistance	I	listened	to	today
at	 the	 gym.	 That	 girl	 could	 have	 been	 the	 love	 of	 my	 life,	 the	 absolute	 perfect
girl	for	me.	Who	knows?	I	never	will.

The	 only	 important	 "skill"	 in	 dating	 is	 learning	 how	 to	 stop	 buying	 into	 your
own	bullshit,	to	stop	believing	your	own	stories.	The	resistance	is	constant.	So
you	 must	 constantly	 fight	 against	 it,	 acknowledge	 the	 stories	 you	 create	 for
yourself,	look	them	in	the	eye	and	say,	“You	know	what,	I	don’t	care	if	she’s	on
her	 phone	 and	 her	 ass	 says	 ‘PINK’	 on	 it,	 I	 want	 to	 meet	 her.”	 And	 then	 do	 it.
Without	hesitation.	Without	fear.	And	without	apology.

Sure,	you’ll	have	to	flex	your	mental	and	emotional	muscles,	and	build	up	your
body	of	self-awareness,	but	here’s	the	good	news:	those	are	the	muscles	chicks
actually	dig.

Unfortunately,	we	all	buy	into	our	own	bullshit.	We	all	believe	our	own	stories
from	 time	 to	 time.	 And	 chances	 are,	 the	 more	 anxiety	 and	 fear	 you	 have
surrounding	 women	 and	 your	 sexuality,	 the	 more	 of	 your	 own	 stories	 and
bullshit	you’ve	bought	into.

Defense	Mechanisms

Most	of	us	have	a	lot	of	fear	and	shame	bundled	up	in	our	sexuality.	These	fears
usually	manifest	themselves	in	a	handful	of	very	specific	scenarios:

-	Fear	of	approaching	and	starting	a	conversation	with	an	attractive	woman

-	Fear	of	stating	sexual	interest	either	directly	or	indirectly	(by	asking	for	a
phone	number,	calling	a	phone	number,	asking	her	out	on	a	date,	etc.)

-	Fear	of	initiating	sexual	contact	(typically	the	first	kiss	situation)

-	Fear	of	actual	sexual	intercourse

The	majority	of	men	experience	at	least	one	of	the	above	fears	to	some	degree
when	it	comes	to	interacting	with	women.	There	is	a	minority	of	men	who	will

be	completely	devoid	of	one	or	more	of	the	above	fears	and	a	very	tiny	minority
who	will	be	devoid	of	all	of	the	fears	above.

These	 anxieties	 are	 manifestations	 of	 neediness	 and	 an	 unwillingness	 to	 be
vulnerable.	 Typically,	 the	 needier	 you	 are	 in	 a	 certain	 area,	 the	 more	 anxiety
you’ll	have	in	that	area.

This	is	unscientific,	but	in	my	experience	coaching	and	working	with	hundreds
of	 men,	 I’ve	 noticed	 correlations	 between	 high	 degrees	 of	 anxiety	 and
experiencing	 one	 or	 more	 of	 the	 following	 situations:	 lack	 of	 a	 father	 figure
growing	 up,	 emotionally	 abusive	 childhood,	 childhood	 traumas,	 strict	 religious
upbringing,	strict	cultural	upbringing,	bullying	or	social	ostracism	growing	up.

The	 sad	 fact	 about	 anxiety	 is	 that	 once	 you	 have	 it,	 it’s	 there	 and	 figuring	 out
why	it’s	there	doesn’t	help	much.	You	can	either	avoid	it	the	rest	of	your	life,	or
you	can	do	something	about	it.

We’re	here	to	do	something	about	it.	This	section	of	the	book	is	called	Honest
Action	for	a	reason.

I	personally	think	anxiety	is	the	biggest	culprit	when	it	comes	to	preventing	men
from	 successfully	 meeting	 and	 dating	 women.	 You	 remove	 anxiety,	 and	 trial-
and-error	will	take	care	of	most	of	the	rest.

Anxiety,	almost	by	its	very	definition,	represents	a	high	level	of	neediness.	Let’s
say	a	beautiful	woman	sits	down	next	to	you	and	you	want	to	say	something	to
her	but	are	scared	to	death.	The	fact	that	you’re	scared	to	death	demonstrates	a
high	 level	 of	 investment	 in	 her	 opinion	 of	 you,	 and	 thus	 a	 high	 degree	 of
neediness.	 This	 neediness	 creates	 a	 fight-or-flight	 response	 in	 us	 —	 a	 surge	 of
adrenaline,	 we	 begin	 sweating,	 our	 mind	 starts	 zipping	 at	 a	 million	 miles	 a
minute,	thinking	of	everything	and	nothing	all	at	once	—	and	if	we	do	manage	to
utter	a	word,	chances	are	we	stutter	and	sputter	and	make	a	red-faced	fool	out	of
ourselves.

This	then	leads	to	further	anxiety	the	next	time	a	beautiful	woman	sits	down	next
to	us.

This	is	a	terrible	conundrum,	and	almost	all	of	us	suffer	from	it	in	some	form	or
another.	I	suffered	from	it	 horribly	 and	 it	 took	 me	 years	 to	 undo	 it.	 Hopefully,
with	what	I	learned,	it	won’t	take	nearly	as	long	or	be	nearly	as	painful	for	you

as	it	was	for	me.

The	first	step	to	overcoming	your	fears	is	to	figure	out	what	your	pattern	is.

When	 we	 are	 confronted	 with	 our	 fears	 or	 anxieties,	 we	 have	 a	 pattern	 or
strategy	that	we	usually	use	to	deal	with	them.	For	instance,	my	most	common
pattern	 is	 apathy.	 Whenever	 I’m	 confronted	 with	 something	 I’m	 afraid	 of,	 I
pretend	—	or	scratch	that,	I	convince	myself	—	that	I	don’t	actually	care.	Here
are	some	of	the	most	common	patterns	that	I’ve	noticed:

1.	 Blame	 Game	 —	 The	 Blame	 Game	 is	 where,	 when	 confronted	 with
something	he’s	afraid	of,	a	man	blames	someone	or	something	else	for	his
fear.

For	instance,	let’s	say	you’re	anxious	about	giving	a	presentation	at	work.
Someone	 who	 does	 the	 Blame	 Game	 will	 come	 up	 with	 reasons	 why	 his
boss	is	stupid	and	how	he’s	way	too	smart	to	be	doing	this	anyway	and	how
it’s	 not	 his	 fault	 if	 things	 go	 wrong	 because	 he’s	 been	 sick	 and	 so-and-so
didn’t	do	enough	research.
In	 the	 context	 of	 women,	 the	 Blame	 Game	 will	 often	 result	 in	 men
convincing	themselves	of	stuff	like,	“Oh,	she’s	stuck	up,”	or	“She’s	just	into
guys	who	are	good-looking,”	or	“She’s	too	stupid	for	me	anyway,”	or	“This
club	is	too	loud	to	talk	to	people,”	or	“Women	in	Miami	are	just	bitches,	I
need	to	find	a	new	city.”

The	 excuses	 and	 blame	 can	 be	 petty	 and	 ridiculous,	 but	 they	 can	 also	 run
deep.	 The	 awful	 part	 of	 the	 blame	 game	 is	 that	 with	 it	 come	 anger	 and
frustration.	And	if	you	do	it	enough,	the	anger	will	pile	up	and	you	will	end
up	 with	 some	 pretty	 bitter	 and	 irrational	 beliefs	 about	 women.	 Men	 who
have	 played	 the	 blame	 game	 their	 whole	 lives	 may	 develop	 screwed	 up
beliefs	like,	“All	women	care	about	is	how	much	money	a	guy	has,”	or	“All
girls	 in	 bars	 are	 stupid	 and	 shallow.”	 This	 can	 lead	 to	 some	 pretty	 dark
places.

2.	Apathy	and	Avoidance	—	This	has	always	been	my	Achilles’	heel,	and
it’s	quite	common.	Experiencing	apathy	and	avoidance	is	exactly	as	it	says:
it’s	 when	 a	 man	 convinces	 himself	 that	 he	 doesn’t	 care	 or	 that	 it’s	 not
important	to	him.	I	did	this	for	years.	I	convinced	myself	that	I	didn’t	care
about	meeting	women	and	that	it	didn’t	really	matter	if	girls	I	liked	didn’t

find	me	attractive.	Well,	after	enough	months	of	sitting	home	alone	looking
at	 porn	 while	 all	 of	 my	 friends	 were	 going	 through	 girlfriend	 after
girlfriend,	 I	 had	 a	 rude	 awakening:	 I	 do	 care.	 Apathy	 and	 avoidance	 isn’t
the	worst	response	when	avoiding	our	fears	with	women	in	that	it	usually
can’t	 last	 forever.	 We’re	 biologically	 compelled	 to	 pursue	 women	 so	 at
some	point,	instinct	will	win	over.	Where	it	is	dangerous	is	in	other	areas	of
our	life	such	as	career,	family	or	hobbies.	The	apathy	and	avoidance	pattern
is	the	root	behind	the	couch	potatoes	and	disgruntled	office	workers	of	the
world.

3.	Intellectualizing	—	I	guarantee	that	this	is	part	of	the	reason	you’re	here:
you	have	some	sort	of	fear,	anxiety	or	pain	related	to	women,	and	instead	of
actually	doing	something	about	it,	you	got	online	and	decided	to	look	up	an
answer	that	you	could	study.

Intellectualizing	 is	 sometimes	 beneficial	 in	 that	 you	 can	 learn	 a	 ton	 of
information	about	a	lot	of	subjects,	and	sometimes,	the	intellectualizing	will
lead	to	more	self-awareness	and	help	clarify	what	sort	of	action	you	need	to
take.	But	there	are	many	men	who	use	intellectualizing	as	just	another	form
of	 avoidance.	 It	 tends	 to	 be	 really	 smart	 guys	 too,	 which	 is	 a	 problem,
because	 the	 smarter	 you	 are,	 the	 more	 you’re	 able	 to	 intellectualize	 and
convince	yourself	that	you	need	to	learn	and	understand	more.

But	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 women,	 this	 is	 not	 the	 answer	 (says	 the	 guy	 who
wrote	a	200-page	book	on	women).	Honestly,	if	you	went	out	and	talked	to
women	 for	 a	 year	 without	 ever	 reading	 a	 word	 of	 dating	 advice,	 you’d
probably	do	OK,	assuming	you	were	honest	with	yourself	and	able	to	learn
from	 your	 mistakes.	 Sure,	 this	 stuff	 all	 helps,	 but	 in	 the	 end,	 your	 best
teacher	 is	 your	 experience.	 There	 comes	 a	 certain	 point	 where	 learning
more	 about	 a	 subject	 is	 no	 longer	 beneficial	 and	 on	 the	 contrary,	 is	 just
going	 to	 get	 you	 more	 mixed	 up	 and	 confused,	 since	 you	 have	 no
experience	to	actually	apply	your	knowledge	to.

Intellectualizing	also	ends	up	having	a	backlash.	Once	you	study	a	subject
enough,	 it	 can	 actually	 increase	 your	 anxiety.	 By	 studying	 it	 so	 much,
you’ve	 put	 more	 pressure	 on	 yourself	 to	 succeed	 and,	 therefore,	 build	 up
higher	expectations	for	yourself.

There	 are	 more	 patterns,	 but	 these	 three	 above	 are	 the	 main	 ones	 that	 I’ve	 run

into	with	men	trying	to	overcome	their	anxieties.

Also,	there’s	a	pattern	within	each	of	the	responses	to	fear	listed	above:	they	aim
to	avoid	the	fear	and	they	usually	do	it	by	convincing	 themselves	of	something
that’s	not	necessarily	true.

The	 blame	 game	 guy	 will	 convince	 himself	 that	 it’s	 her	 fault.	 The	 apathy	 guy
will	 convince	 himself	 that	 it	 doesn’t	 matter.	 The	 intellectualizing	 guy	 will
convince	 himself	 that	 he	 needs	 to	 learn	 and	 understand	 more	 first.	 In	 the	 end,
they're	all	avoiding	what	they're	afraid	of.

Also,	 realize	 that	 no	 one	 uses	 just	 one	 defense	 mechanism.	 We	 all	 use	 each	 of
them	 some	 of	 the	 time.	 In	 fact,	 we	 may	 stack	 them	 on	 top	 of	 each	 other.	 For
example,	 “I	 don’t	 care	 what	 the	 girls	 think	 here	 because	 they’re	 all	 stuck	 up
bitches,	so	I’m	going	to	go	home,"	neatly	stacks	apathy	on	top	of	blame.

With	 that	 said,	 we	 all	 seem	 to	 have	 a	 favorite	 pattern	 that	 we	 fall	 back	 on	 the
most	often.

The	key	to	overcoming	your	fears	is	first	and	foremost	to	break	your	patterned
response	 to	 your	 fear.	 This	 requires	 a	 certain	 level	 of	 self-awareness	 and
discipline.

So	for	instance,	when	I	was	learning	to	approach	women,	I	had	a	lot	of	fear	and
anxiety.	And	my	pattern	was	apathy.	So	I’d	be	hanging	out	in	a	bar,	see	a	cute
girl	I	liked,	and	my	immediate	reaction	would	be	to	say	something	like,	“Eh,	I
don’t	really	feel	like	talking	right	now,”	or	“I	don’t	feel	like	meeting	girls	right
now.”	 This	 was	 complete	 bullshit.	 I	 had	 purposely	 gone	 out	 that	 night	 for	 no
other	 reason	 than	 to	 meet	 women.	 I	 had	 been	 reading	 books	 and	 websites	 all
week	about	nothing	but	meeting	girls.	I	wanted	to	meet	girls.

It	wasn’t	until	I	became	aware	of	this	pattern	that	I	was	able	to	start	breaking	it
and	forcing	myself	to	talk	to	that	woman	I	wanted	to	talk	to,	even	when	my	mind
was	telling	me	that	I	didn’t	want	to.

So	here	are	some	helpful	ways	to	break	your	own	pattern:

1.	 Take	 a	 moment	 and	 think	 about	 what	 you’re	 most	 anxious	 about.	 Is	 it
approaching?	Is	it	showing	sexual	interest?	Is	it	asking	a	woman	out?	Is	it
the	first	kiss?

2.	Now	write	down	your	pattern	with	it.	So	for	instance,	“Calling	women,
pattern	is	apathy,”	or	“Approaching	women,	pattern	is	blame	game.”

3.	Now,	create	a	goal	for	yourself,	for	instance,	“Call	every	phone	number	I
get,	no	matter	how	much	I	don’t	care.”	Write	it	down.

4.	Tell	a	friend	or	a	buddy	what	you	plan	on	doing	and	ask	him	to	keep	you
accountable.

That	 last	 item	 is	 important.	 Sharing	 your	 fears	 and	 having	 someone	 keep	 you
accountable	is	integral	to	this	whole	process	and	makes	it	10	times	easier.	Even
the	 very	 act	 of	 sharing	 your	 fear	 with	 someone	 who	 can	 empathize	 and
understand	goes	a	long	way	towards	relieving	the	pressure.

You	Are	Not	a	Victim

One	assumption	I’ve	lived	my	life	by	for	a	long	time	now	goes	like	this:	“If	it’s	a
question	of	me	being	screwed	up	or	masses	of	people	being	screwed	up	in	the
same	way,	then	it’s	far	more	likely	that	it’s	just	me	being	screwed	up.”

Just	to	name	an	obvious	example.	Men	often	come	to	me	and	say	something	like
this:	“I	go	out	and	try	to	meet	women,	but	the	problem	is	all	of	the	girls	in	my
town	are	catty	and	immature.	So	I	guess	I	just	need	to	move	to	a	new	city.”

Really?	 So,	 it’s	 not	 you	 who’s	 screwed	 up,	 it’s	 the	 150,000+	 single	 women	 in
your	city	who	are	all	screwed	up	—	in	the	exact	same	way.	What	are	the	odds	of
that?

Or	you	get	men	who	claim	that	every	—	not	some,	not	most,	but	all	—	American
women	 are	 fickle	 and	 too	 individualistic.	 Or	 that	 all	 women	 who	 dress
provocatively	are	immoral	cheaters	and	would	never	make	a	good	girlfriend.

Men	make	negative	assumptions	and	stereotypes	about	millions	of	women	for	no
other	 reason	 than	 to	 shirk	 responsibility	 for	 their	 own	 shortcomings.	 This
appears	to	me	to	be	nothing	but	a	victim	mentality	and	it	pervades	a	lot	of	men’s
thinking,	some	in	more	obvious	ways	than	others.

This	doesn’t	necessarily	mean	the	general	observations	are	wrong,	it	just	means
you’re	 interpreting	 them	 in	 such	 a	 way	 to	 victimize	 yourself.	 Sure,	 American

women	 may	 be	 more	 fickle	 and	 pretentious	 than	 their	 European	 counterparts
(then	 again,	 they	 may	 not	 be).	 Women	 in	 your	 town	 might	 actually	 be	 more
closed	 off	 than	 women	 in	 a	 bigger	 city	 (or	 they	 might	 not	 be).	 But	 you’re
choosing	to	let	those	observations	be	responsible	for	your	own	actions.	This	is
the	definition	of	being	over-invested	in	others	and	being	needy.

Humans	 stereotype	 for	 a	 reason:	 so	 that	 we	 can	 manage	 large	 chunks	 of
information	to	orient	ourselves	more	efficiently.	Often,	stereotypes	can	be	useful.
But	usually	they’re	not.	Often	they’re	nothing	more	than	excuses	—	ways	for	us
to	avoid	the	blame	and	responsibility	for	not	being	satisfied	with	our	results.	And
these	excuses	hurt	us	and	shut	us	off	from	opportunities.	If	we're	blaming	others,
we're	not	learning.	And	if	we're	not	learning,	we're	not	improving.

So	returning	to	the	“women	in	my	town	are	cold”	example.	Yeah,	they	may,	on
average,	be	colder	than	say,	Las	Vegas	women.	But	are	all	of	them?	No.	Maybe
40%?	50%?	But	if	you	write	them	all	off	as	being	cold	and	use	it	as	an	excuse
and	not	take	responsibility,	you’re	effectively	shutting	yourself	off	from	50%	of
the	 women	 in	 your	 town.	 You’re	 effectively	 missing	 out	 on	 hundreds	 of
opportunities.

The	 same	 goes	 for	 complaints	 against	 American	 women.	 There	 are	 something
like	 40	 million	 single	 women	 in	 the	 US.	 And	 you	 truly	 believe	 you	 can’t	 find
one	 good	 one?	 Whose	 fault	 is	 that?	 It’s	 your	 fault.	 You’re	 being	 lazy.	 You’re
being	lazy	and	unfairly	judging	millions	of	women	all	because	you	aren’t	willing
to	take	responsibility	for	your	failures.

I	believe	strongly	in	taking	responsibility	for	everything	that	happens	to	you	in
your	life.	Our	minds	are	always	looking	for	ways	to	avoid	pain	and	failure	and
rejection,	 and	 so	 they	 constantly	 churn	 out	 rationalizations	 to	 keep	 us
impeccable;	it’s	them	who	fucked	up,	not	us.	We're	fine.	We	did	everything	right.
It's	that	fucked	up	world's	fault	we're	not	happy.

Blame	is	yet	another	form	of	neediness.	It’s	prioritizing	others	over	yourself.	As
long	as	it’s	their	fault,	then	you	don’t	have	to	make	yourself	vulnerable.

But	when	you	practice	taking	responsibility	for	everything	that	happens	in	your
life,	 you	 stop	 blaming	 others.	 It	 becomes	 less	 a	 question	 of	 blame	 and	 more	 a
question	 of	 sacrifice.	 It’s	 no	 longer	 their	 fault	 that	 you’re	 still	 single	 because
they’re	all	cold	bitches,	but	now	it’s	your	fault	and	a	question	of	whether	you’re

willing	to	sacrifice	the	extra	effort	or	not	to	find	a	woman	who	isn’t	a	cold	bitch.
Taking	responsibility	and	morphing	blame	into	sacrifice	empowers	you.	It	puts
the	ball	in	your	court	and	returns	you	to	the	healthy	reality	that	the	only	person
in	this	world	who	determines	your	success	and	failure	is	you.

The	 question	 of	 blame,	 responsibility,	 and	 sacrifice	 is	 a	 profound	 one	 in
relationships	as	well.	Dysfunctional	relationships	almost	always	crumble	under
the	 pressure	 of	 one	 person	 blaming	 the	 other	 for	 their	 shortcomings	 or
transgressions.	Research	has	shown	a	direct	correlation	between	the	amount	of
blame	leveled	between	partners	and	their	propensity	to	break	up.	The	recipe	for	a
healthy	and	happy	relationship	is	one	where	both	partners	take	responsibility	for
their	own	emotions	and	their	choice	to	commit	to	the	other.

Earlier	 in	 the	 book,	 I	 mentioned	 that	 before	 I	 got	 into	 all	 of	 this	 dating	 advice
stuff,	I	dated	a	girl	for	four	years	in	high	school	and	college.	I	was	madly	in	love
with	her	and	she	ended	up	cheating	on	me	and	leaving	me	for	another	guy.	For	a
long	time,	I	blamed	her	and	I	was	very	angry.

Rightly	so.

But	as	time	passed,	I	recognized	a	few	things:	1)	I	wasn’t	exactly	boyfriend-of-
the-year,	and	in	many	ways,	her	cheating	and	leaving	me	wasn’t	very	surprising;
2)	 there	 were	 plenty	 of	 warning	 signs	 that	 I	 chose	 to	 ignore	 or	 was	 just
completely	 oblivious	 to;	 and	 3)	 regardless	 of	 her	 actions,	 I	 made	 a	 conscious
choice	to	commit	to	her	day	in	and	day	out,	and	the	risk	of	being	cheated	on	was
always	 a	 possibility	 in	 that	 commitment.	 The	 awful	 result	 of	 that	 relationship
was	 a	 possibility	 I	 had	 been	 aware	 of	 from	 day	 one.	 Yes,	 she	 did	 something
shitty,	but	I	also	chose	to	trust	her.

In	the	end,	I	made	the	conscious	decision	that	I	was	willing	to	sacrifice	the	risk
of	 being	 hurt	 in	 order	 to	 enjoy	 the	 commitment	 of	 our	 relationship.	 And	 I
wouldn’t	take	that	decision	back.	It	was	my	responsibility.

When	I	was	younger,	I	used	to	have	a	love/hate	relationship	for	superficial	party
girls.	I	was	young	and	had	seen	in	a	movie	that	I	was	supposed	to	be	some	studly
party	guy,	and	so	I	spent	a	lot	of	time	trying	to	attract	drunk	party	girls	and	have
sex	with	them.	It	frustrated	me	for	a	long	time	and	the	‘hate’	part	of	the	love/hate
was	that	I	came	to	see	them	as	fickle,	stupid	and	shallow.

Now,	that	may	be	true,	but	I	was	blaming	them	for	my	lack	of	success	with	them.

I	mean,	how	dare	they	not	be	attracted	to	me!	If	they	weren’t	so	dumb,	they’d	be
lining	up	to	sleep	with	me,	and	that’s	how	the	world	should	be,	right?

No,	 it	 shouldn’t.	 That	 was	 an	 immature	 and	 entitled	 mindset	 to	 have.	 I	 was
blaming	them	for	something	I	was	responsible	for.	And	by	doing	so,	I	refused	to
respect	them	as	human	beings,	and	rather,	I	was	choosing	to	see	them	merely	as
gyrating	sexual	pleasure	objects	that	were	to	be	conquered,	like	in	a	video	game.

The	 truth	 was	 I	 had	 to	 make	 a	 choice:	 was	 I	 willing	 to	 work	 to	 expand	 my
communication	 in	 order	 to	 connect	 with	 girls	 like	 that?	 At	 the	 end	 of	 the	 day,
that’s	the	only	relevant	question.	The	women	you	meet	will	be	the	women	you
meet,	but	are	you	willing	to	put	in	the	effort	to	make	something	of	it?	When	I
did,	I	found	something	out:	that	many	of	them	were	not	so	stupid	and	shallow
and	superficial	after	all.	In	fact,	many	of	them	are	smart,	interesting	and	fun	—
and	beautiful!	But	until	I	opened	myself	up	to	that	possibility	and	took	it	upon
myself	to	find	them,	I	was	missing	out.

Challenge	yourself	to	find	the	good	and	beautiful	thing	inside	of	everyone.	It’s
there.	It’s	your	job	to	find	it.	Not	their	job	to	show	you.

Sexual	Motivation

Another	problem	a	lot	of	men	run	into,	aside	from	their	fears	and	their	anxieties,
is	a	seeming	lack	of	motivation	to	get	out	there	and	pursue	women.	It’s	one	thing
to	 sit	 at	 home	 and	 read	 books	 like	 this	 one,	 but	 it’s	 something	 completely
different	 to	 actually	 get	 off	 your	 ass	 on	 a	 Saturday	 and	 force	 yourself	 to	 meet
women.	It	takes	a	lot	of	effort	at	first,	and	some	men	are	easily	able	to	convince
themselves	that	it	may	not	be	worth	the	effort.

Since	the	advent	of	internet	pornography,	it’s	become	easier	than	ever	for	men	to
satisfy	their	sexual	urges.	And	today,	there’s	an	entire	generation	that	has	grown
up	 always	 having	 access	 to	 as	 much	 pornography	 as	 they	 want	 since	 a	 young
age.

There	 are	 a	 lot	 of	 anti-pornography	 movements,	 and	 there	 are	 even	 theories
about	 “pornography	 addiction”	 that	 are	 thrown	 around.	 Although	 there’s	 no
absolute	scientific	proof	(yet)	for	porn	addiction,	here’s	something	I	can	tell	you
that	is	absolutely	true:	porn	harms	your	motivation	to	pursue	women	in	real	life.

There’s	 a	 bit	 of	 an	 epidemic	 of	 sexual	 apathy	 going	 on	 worldwide,	 where
husbands,	boyfriends	and	even	single	men	are	turning	to	pornography	rather	than
the	real	life	women	that	they	see	walking	around	every	day.	And	it	makes	sense
why:	it’s	easier,	the	women	are	hot,	the	sex	is	more	exciting,	it’s	available	at	any
time	 with	 the	 click	 of	 a	 mouse,	 it’s	 (usually)	 free,	 the	 girls	 never	 say	 no,	 it’s
emotionless	and	there	are	no	obligations	or	commitments	involved.

The	problem	is	that	there	are	some	negative	side	effects.	The	first	being	that	porn
creates	very,	very	 unrealistic	 expectations	 about	 sex,	 about	 women,	 and	 about
sexuality.	 Porn	 makes	 money	 by	 accentuating	 and	 exaggerating	 sexual	 ideals.
Actual	sex	with	an	actual	woman	often	involves	awkward	moments	of	figuring
out	what	she	likes,	what	you	like,	who	likes	it	which	way.	It	also	often	involves
ecstatic	moments	of	emotional	intimacy,	something	porn	can	never	provide.

Also,	 real	 women,	 no	 matter	 how	 hot	 they	 are,	 have	 imperfections	 —
imperfections	that	are	covered	up	in	porn	by	makeup	and	plastic	surgery.	If	a	guy
gets	too	accustomed	to	the	perfectionism	of	porn,	he’s	going	to	have	a	lot	more
trouble	becoming	motivated	by	the	girls	he	sees	every	day.

The	other	problem	is	that	porn	is	so	easy,	that	it	encourages	men	to	masturbate	a
lot.	And	as	we	all	know,	as	men,	the	more	we	masturbate,	the	more	interested	we
become	 in	 food	 and	 television,	 and	 the	 less	 we	 become	 in	 women	 and
accomplishing	something.

Napoleon	Hill	wrote	a	famous	section	in	his	classic	work	Think	and	Grow	Rich
called	 “Sexual	 Transfiguration.”	 Hill	 noticed	 and	 theorized	 that	 extremely
successful	men	also	had	extremely	high	sex	drives.	And	not	only	did	they	have
very	high	sex	drives,	but	they	also	channeled	this	sexual	energy	into	their	work
and	their	accomplishments.	Often	they	would	abstain	from	sex	or	masturbation
for	long	periods	of	time	and	would,	therefore,	feel	more	energized.

Science	is	starting	to	back	this	up.	Orgasms,	or	more	accurately,	ejaculation	 in
men,	 actually	 causes	 a	 depletion	 of	 various	 hormones	 and	 endorphins	 which
often	lead	to	useful	behaviors	as	well	as	motivation.

Men	 who	 have	 masturbated	 constantly	 since	 adolescence	 often	 masturbate	 so
hard	and	furiously	that	they	desensitize	their	penis	to	realistic	scenarios.	When
you	 masturbate	 three	 times	 a	 day	 for	 years	 straight,	 you	 often	 have	 to	 grip
yourself	 very	 hard	 and	 rub	 furiously	 to	 get	 off.	 This	 can	 often	 lead	 to	 sexual

issues	and	impotence	when	a	man	actually	does	get	into	bed	with	a	woman.	This
is	 because	 vaginas	 are	 soft,	 they’re	 wet,	 and	 the	 sensations	 they	 give	 you	 are
subtle.	Your	iron-fisted	grip	 does	a	horrible	job	of	preparing	you	for	the	 warm
lady	love.

So	 here’s	 what	 I	 recommend	 to	 you	 and	 all	 men	 who	 are	 looking	 to	 get
motivated	and	improve	themselves.	It’s	my	patented	masturbation	and	porn	diet
that	I	give	to	men.	In	fact,	I	still	go	on	this	diet	myself	from	time	to	time	when	I
want	 to	 add	 a	 little	 motivation	 to	 my	 life.	 It	 works	 wonders,	 and	 a	 lot	 of	 men
have	gotten	stunning	results	from	it.	I’ve	talked	to	guys	who	literally	sat	around
reading	 dating	 advice	 for	 years	 without	 ever	 taking	 action,	 but	 on	 my
masturbation	 and	 porn	 diet,	 within	 two	 weeks	 they	 were	 out	 there	 meeting
women	and	trying	to	get	dates.

So	without	further	ado...

-	End	all	pornography	immediately.	Starting	today.	Delete	everything	from
your	computer.	Throw	out	any	discs	or	DVDs	 you	have.	And	if	you	have
trouble	 controlling	 your	 urges,	 download	 some	 free	 website	 blocking
software	 and	 block	 every	 porn	 site	 you	 know	 of	 indefinitely.	 This	 may
sound	horrible	or	extreme,	but	trust	me.	You	will	thank	me	in	a	month.

-	Limit	your	masturbation	to	once	a	week.	Schedule	it.	Pick	a	day.	I	usually
pick	Monday.	Do	not	deviate	from	your	masturbation	schedule!	If	you	want
even	a	larger	dose	of	motivation	(and	you	want	to	be	as	horny	as	a	14-year
old),	limit	your	masturbation	to	once	every	other	week.	Again,	pick	a	day
and	hold	yourself	to	it.

-	 When	 you	 masturbate,	 you’re	 only	 allowed	 to	 fantasize	 about	 women
you’ve	 met	 and	 have	 not	 had	 sex	 with.	 It	 could	 be	 that	 woman	 at	 work.
That	girl	you	met	Saturday	night.	The	girl	you	have	a	date	with	that	week.
Whatever.	But	she	has	to	be	real,	and	she	has	to	be	someone	you	have	not
slept	with	(but	obviously	want	to).

-	When	you	masturbate,	use	lotion	or	lube.	Do	it	slower	than	usual.	Drag	it
out	longer	than	10	minutes	if	you	can.	Take	your	time	with	it.	Enjoy	it.	You
don’t	get	to	do	this	every	day,	remember?

Follow	this	for	a	few	weeks	and	you	should	find	yourself	motivated.	If	you	mess
up	or	give	in,	just	start	over	again.	Don’t	be	hard	on	yourself.	Ideally,	within	a

couple	weeks,	the	idea	of	going	out	to	approach	women	should	sound	exciting	to
you	instead	of	a	chore.	This	is	good.	So	go	out	and	do	it!

Chapter	10:
How	to	Overcome	Anxiety

Think	 back	 to	 the	 last	 time	 someone	 you	 didn’t	 want	 to	 see	 tried	 to	 hang	 out
with	 you.	 Maybe	 it	 was	 that	 annoying	 guy	 at	 work.	 Maybe	 it	 was	 your	 black-
sheep	 brother-in-law.	 Maybe	 it	 was	 a	 blind	 date	 when	 your	 mother	 tried	 to	 set
you	 up	 with	 her	 friend’s	 daughter.	 Think	 of	 that	 awkward	 situation	 where	 you
had	to	turn	someone	down.	Think	back	to	the	last	time	you	had	to	politely	come
up	with	excuses	to	not	spend	time	with	somebody.	How	did	it	make	you	feel?

Not	good.

Rejecting	 people,	 whether	 you’re	 doing	 it	 blatantly	 (“Go	 away	 and	 leave	 me
alone”)	or	indirectly	(“Oh,	I’m	actually	really	busy	this	weekend,	maybe	another
time”)	is	actually	an	awkward	and	uncomfortable	situation	that	nobody	enjoys.
Extremely	few	people	in	this	world	enjoy	being	an	asshole	or	hurting	someone
else’s	feelings.

Now	 imagine	 having	 to	 do	 this	 on	 an	 almost	 weekly	 basis.	 There’s	 nothing
gratifying	 about	 it,	 in	 fact,	 it	 becomes	 frustrating	 and	 tedious.	 It	 also	 explains
why	women	seem	to	complain	about	guys	hitting	on	them	or	about	guys	being
creepy	 —	 they	 have	 to	 reject	 them,	 and	 rejecting	 someone	 is	 generally	 an
unpleasant	or	uncomfortable	experience.

Men	 who	 have	 the	 perception	 of	 women	 as	 these	 ego-centric	 creatures	 who
laugh	 at	 us	 from	 their	 sexual	 mountain-tops,	 doling	 out	 which	 man	 gets	 (a
chance	 at)	 the	 divine	 pussy	 access	 and	 which	 man	 gets	 to	 squander	 away	 his
time	in	solitude	—	it	doesn’t	work	like	that.

Think	 about	 it.	 Why	 do	 women	 spend	 so	 much	 time	 and	 effort	 on	 their
appearance?	Why	do	they	go	to	singles’	bars	and	join	dating	sites	and	give	blind
dates	a	try?	They	don’t	do	it	so	that	they	can	revel	in	rejecting	a	bunch	of	guys.
They’re	just	as	lonely	and	frustrated	as	we	are.	They	want	to	meet	a	man.	But
not	 just	 any	 man,	 a	 great	 man	 —	 a	 man	 who	 is	 confident,	 charming,	 fun,	 and
interesting.	A	man	who	is	non-needy,	who	is	vulnerable,	and	who	will	honestly
express	himself	to	her.

She	wants	you	to	be	that	man.	She’s	secretly	rooting	for	you.	She	doesn’t	want	to
reject	 you.	 Every	 time	 a	 new	 man	 walks	 up	 to	 her,	 she’s	 secretly	 saying	 to
herself,	“Please,	please,	please	be	the	man.	Be	the	attractive	man	that	I	can’t	say
no	 to.”	 And	 then	 he	 nervously	 stutters	 around	 buying	 her	 a	 drink	 and	 makes
uncomfortable	 jokes	 about	 the	 weather	 and	 she’s	 back	 to	 that	 horribly
uncomfortable	position	of	having	to	reject	him	again.

Other	 times	 it	 doesn’t	 even	 get	 that	 far.	 It’s	 obvious	 before	 he	 even	 opens	 his
mouth	that	it’s	game	over.	He’s	dressed	like	a	clown	or	hasn’t	combed	his	hair	in
three	months,	or	he’s	too	drunk	to	even	look	at	her	directly.

This	 is	 also	 why	 women	 are	 willing	 to	 overlook	 a	 lot	 of	 bonehead	 moves	 and
mistakes	 we	 make	 if	 they	 like	 us.	 It’s	 amazing	 how	 many	 second	 and	 third
chances	 a	 woman	 will	 give	 you	 if	 she	 likes	 you.	 She’s	 rooting	 for	 you.	 She’s
your	 biggest	 fan.	 She’s	 saying,	 “Oh,	 he	 chickened	 out	 on	 asking	 me	 out	 this
time,	but	I’ll	find	an	excuse	to	call	him	so	maybe	he’ll	do	it	next	time.”	They’re
begging	for	you	to	succeed.	They	want	it	just	as	bad	as	you	do.	That	women	at
the	 party,	 in	 the	 coffee	 shop,	 on	 the	 dating	 site,	 they	 want	 you	 to	 be	 that
unbelievably	 attractive	 man,	 that	 man	 who	 makes	 time	 stop	 for	 them	 and	 can
make	them	feel	things	they’ve	never	felt	before.	They	want	you	to	be	that.	And
when	they	reject	you,	it’s	not	because	they	enjoy	it,	or	because	they	have	a	big
ego,	or	because	you’re	too	short	or	your	muscles	aren’t	big	enough…

It’s	because	you	didn’t	give	her	that	feeling.	You	didn’t	make	her	spin	and	fall
and	laugh	and	forget	where	she	was	or	who	she	was	with.	That’s	what	she	goes
out	looking	for:	the	man	who	can	make	her	feel	more	alive.

The	next	time	you	make	your	move,	when	she	sees	you	coming	—	and	trust	me,
she	 usually	 sees	 you	 coming	 —	 know	 that	 she’s	 already	 rooting	 for	 you.
Secretly,	she	wants	you	to	succeed	as	much	as	you	do.	And	for	a	moment,	she’s
your	biggest	fan.

And	your	role	as	a	man	is	to	take	action.	It’s	all	on	you.	It’s	always	on	you.	You
move	things	forward.

And	this	is	where	the	vast	majority	of	men	falter.	An	action	as	simple	as	opening
your	mouth,	moving	your	feet	in	the	right	direction,	or	picking	up	the	phone	—
they	simply	don’t	do	it.	The	fear	and	rationalizations	mentioned	in	the	previous
chapter	are	too	large.	It	feels	too	overwhelming.	And	nothing	gets	done.

And	ultimately,	no	matter	how	much	you	read,	how	much	you	study,	how	much
you	 watch	 about	 dating	 and	 attracting	 women,	 if	 you’re	 unable	 to	 take	 action,
you	will	get	nowhere.

Chances	 are	 if	 you’re	 reading	 this,	 this	 is	 not	 the	 first	 book	 on	 dating	 or
attraction	that	you’ve	ever	read.	Some	men	become	self-help	and	dating	advice
junkies,	reading	and	reading	and	reading	and	never	taking	action.

In	 fact,	 sometimes	 men	 use	 reading	 and	 hoarding	 information	 and	 advice	 as	 a
way	to	avoid	taking	action.	They	feel	like	if	they’re	reading	a	150-page	book	on
attraction,	 then	 they’re	 accomplishing	 something	 right?	 And	 as	 long	 as	 they’re
accomplishing	 something,	 then	 they	 don’t	 have	 to	 confront	 what	 they’re	 afraid
of:	going	out	and	standing	in	front	of	a	woman	and	expressing	their	truth,	being
vulnerable,	subjecting	themselves	to	rejection.

This	isn’t	a	new	problem.	The	self-help	and	business	advice	industries	have	been
dealing	with	it	for	decades.	The	men’s	dating	advice	industry	has	been	dealing
with	 it	 as	 well.	 But	 up	 until	 this	 point,	 it’s	 done	 a	 piss-poor	 job	 of	 motivating
men	and	helping	to	teach	them	how	to	take	action.

The	classic	advice	when	it	comes	to	taking	action	is	more	or	less	to	jump	into	the
deep	end	until	you	learn	to	swim.

The	idea	was	that	if	you	had	a	crippling	fear	of	approaching	women,	then	you
sign	up	for	a	“boot	camp”	or	program	where	a	coach	takes	you	out	to	a	bar	and
more	or	less	yells	at	you	until	you	approach	25	women	in	one	night.	What	you
say	and	what	happens	is	all	over	the	place,	but	at	least	you’re	getting	off	your	ass
and	doing	something.

The	problem	with	the	overload	method	of	taking	action	is	that	it’s	short-term	and
doesn’t	 create	 a	 lasting	 habit.	 There’s	 a	 simpler	 and	 less	 stressful	 method	 for
achieving	long-term	results	over	your	anxieties.

The	Guide	to	Overcoming	Your	Anxiety

Fear	is	normal.	Everyone	has	it	in	some	form,	and	it's	not	going	away	anytime
soon.	The	trick	isn't	to	eliminate	it;	it's	simply	to	train	yourself	to	behave	despite
it.

Saying	you	want	to	get	rid	of	all	of	your	fear	is	like	saying	you	want	to	get	rid	of
all	 anger,	 or	 all	 sadness.	 This	 sounds	 like	 a	 noble	 goal,	 but	 research	 shows	 we
instead	suppress	or	avoid	the	emotions,	leaving	us	less	capable	of	dealing	with
them	the	next	time	they	arise.	Instead,	what	I	recommend	is	to	learn	to	adapt	our
negative	emotions	into	positive	behavior.

For	 instance,	 people	 with	 anger	 issues	 are	 encouraged	 to	 channel	 their	 anger
through	productive	means	—	exercising,	working,	writing	letters	displaying	their
feelings,	 etc.	 To	 avoid	 or	 ignore	 the	 anger	 will	 only	 bring	 it	 back	 worse	 next
time.

When	my	first	girlfriend	broke	up	with	me,	I	made	a	conscious	decision.	I	had
laid	 in	 bed	 depressed	 for	 a	 week	 or	 two	 before	 I	 realized	 how	 ridiculous	 and
pointless	 it	 was.	 I	 was	 hurt	 and	 I	 was	 angry,	 but	 laying	 around	 in	 bed	 and
avoiding	her	was	stressing	me	out.	If	I’m	going	to	be	stressed	out,	I	may	as	well
be	productive.

So	I	decided	to	try	another	strategy.	I	decided	that	I	would	work	on	myself.	I	told
myself	I	was	doing	it	so	that	she	would	be	sorry	she	ever	broke	up	with	me.	I	did
it	out	of	spite.	My	inspiration	for	self-improvement	began	with	revenge.

For	the	first	time	in	my	life,	I	joined	a	gym.	I	began	studying	more.	I	went	out
with	a	female	 friend	and	 bought	some	new	clothes.	I	went	to	 parties	with	new
people	I	met.	The	whole	time	my	motivation	was	the	anger	and	hurt	that	I	had
towards	my	ex-girlfriend.	I	was	going	to	become	such	an	amazing	person,	she'd
be	sorry	she	ever	left	me.

The	same	concept	can	be	applied	to	your	fear	and	anxiety	around	women.

The	 other	 problem	 with	 interpreting	 the	 anxiety	 around	 women	 as	 something
that	must	be	removed	is	that	this	often	only	serves	to	amplify	it.	Neurobiology
has	shown	us	that	attempting	to	avoid	or	shut	out	something	we’re	afraid	of	only
serves	to	make	that	fear	stronger.

For	instance,	if	you’ve	ever	played	a	sport	and	were	in	a	situation	where	you	had
to	hit	one	shot	to	win	the	game,	you	know	that	thinking	about	the	pressure	and
the	situation	and	trying	to	be	relaxed	about	it	only	makes	you	more	nervous	and
anxious.

The	actual	way	to	deal	with	it	is	to	accept	it,	embrace	it,	and	harness	it	to	make

your	performance	better.

In	Buddhism,	there’s	a	saying,	“What	you	resist	will	persist.”	And	it’s	true	in	this
case	as	well.

The	proper	 way	to	handle	your	fear	and	your	anxiety	is	to	accept	it,	recognize
that	it’s	normal	and	a	part	of	who	you	are,	and	to	not	even	try	to	hide	it	from	the
woman	you’re	meeting.

Think	back	to	something	you’re	very,	very	good	at.	Maybe	you’re	really	great	at
some	part	of	your	job	at	work.	Or	maybe	you	used	to	be	awesome	at	tennis	or
chess	back	in	school.	Maybe	you’re	a	great	public	speaker.

All	 of	 those	 activities,	 when	 you	 were	 called	 on	 to	 put	 yourself	 on	 the	 line
(major	tennis	match,	big	presentation,	major	meeting	to	lead),	you	probably	got
nervous	 beforehand.	 But	 did	 that	 nervousness	 make	 you	 crumble	 or	 did	 it
invigorate	you?

I	used	to	love	giving	presentations	in	school.	I	was	great	at	them.	I	used	to	get
nervous	 before	 every	 single	 one.	 In	 fact,	 I’ve	 given	 probably	 75	 seminars	 and
speaking	 engagements	 for	 my	 business	 over	 the	 past	 five	 years.	 I	 was	 nervous
before	every	single	one	of	those	too.

But	 the	 nervousness	 almost	 felt	 good.	 I	 was	 confident	 in	 my	 ability.	 It	 was	 a
borderline	excitement.	I	knew	I	was	going	to	blow	everybody	away.	I	knew	that
they	 would	 love	 me.	 So	 even	 though	 I	 was	 nervous	 to	 get	 up	 there,	 I	 couldn’t
wait.

It’s	 like	 professional	 athletes	 who	 say	 they	 can’t	 sleep	 the	 night	 before	 a	 big
game.	They’re	nervous,	but	they	can’t	wait	to	get	out	there.	They’re	confident	in
their	ability	and	thrive	on	the	pressure	and	the	anxiety.

Psychological	 research	 actually	 shows	 that	 people	 perform	 better	 at	 activities
under	a	certain	amount	of	anxiety.	In	fact,	what	matters	isn’t	the	anxiety	itself,
but	 the	 person’s	 confidence	 in	 their	 own	 ability	 to	 perform	 whatever	 action
they’re	anxious	about.

So	it’s	less	about	the	anxiety	and	more	about	how	competent	you	feel	you	are.
The	 less	 competent	 you	 feel,	 the	 more	 the	 anxiety	 will	 hinder	 you,	 the	 more
confident	you	are	in	your	ability,	the	more	the	anxiety	will	help	you.

This	 is	 actually	 where	 a	 lot	 of	 dating	 advice	 and	 pick	 up	 theory	 actually	 hurts
you.	 They	 explain	 these	 complicated	 models	 and	 theories,	 give	 you	 tons	 of
material	 to	 memorize	 and	 practice,	 and	 present	 picking	 up	 women	 as	 some
complicated	 task	 akin	 to	 rocket	 science	 that	 only	 works	 once	 you’ve	 tried	 and
failed	1,000	times.	That’s	going	to	scare	the	shit	out	of	any	guy	with	little	to	no
experience.

The	opposite	is	true.	Attracting	women	is	not	complicated.	And	if	you	can	have
a	conversation	with	a	friend	or	family	member,	then	you	already	possess	the	only
“skill-set”	required	in	attracting	a	woman.	There’s	nothing	to	learn,	only	things
to	do.	And	the	fear	doesn’t	go	away,	you	learn	to	hone	it	to	help	you.

I	still	get	nervous	every	time	I	approach	a	beautiful	woman	I	don’t	know.	I’ve
approached	probably	over	2,000	at	this	point.	I	still	get	nervous	every	time	I	go
to	kiss	one.	And	I’ve	probably	kissed	at	least	300	at	this	point.	I	still	get	nervous
every	time	I	bring	a	new	girl	home.	And	I’ve	slept	with	over	100	women.

The	fear	never	goes	away.	What	changes	is	my	neediness	and	vulnerability.	The
difference	between	now	and	2005	is	that	back	then,	I	was	incredibly	needy	and
highly	 invested	 in	 how	 women	 perceived	 me.	 These	 combined	 to	 amplify	 my
anxiety	in	ways	that	were	unbearable.

See,	 a	 lot	 of	 people	 assume	 non-neediness	 means	 being	 fearless.	 But	 non-
neediness	simply	means	to	feel	the	fear	and	not	let	it	define	you.	Non-neediness
is	feeling	the	fear	and	deciding	that	something	else	is	more	important.

If	I	say	or	do	something	that	screws	everything	up	(and	I	still	do	all	the	time),	I
don’t	 really	 care.	 It	 doesn’t	 change	 how	 I	 feel	 about	 myself,	 and	 it	 doesn’t
change	my	confidence	in	my	ability	to	interact	with	women	in	the	future.

What’s	 important	 is	 not	 the	 level	 of	 anxiety	 or	 fear,	 but	 your	 competence	 at
whatever	you’re	afraid	of	doing.

So	now	you’re	probably	saying,	“Well,	that’s	nice,	you’re	that	confident	because
you’ve	 been	 with	 so	 many	 women,	 but	 what	 about	 a	 guy	 who	 has	 little	 to	 no
experience	with	women?”

Glad	you	asked.

Like	 I	 said	 before,	 when	 it	 came	 to	 dealing	 with	 fear	 and	 rejection,	 all	 dating

coaches	basically	took	the	approach	of	“throw	him	into	the	deep	end	and	hope	he
learns	to	swim.”

If	you	were	afraid	to	approach	random	women,	they	would	give	you	crazy	lines
or	 push	 you	 into	 very	 intimidating	 and	 difficult	 social	 situations,	 hoping	 to
“scare	you	straight.”

The	 idea	 was	 if	 they	 could	 put	 you	 in	 the	 worst	 possible	 situations,	 then	 the
simple,	regular	social	situations	would	stop	being	intimidating.

I	guess	it’s	like	taking	someone	who	wants	to	get	in	shape	and	putting	them	in	a
marathon	right	away.	It’ll	help,	but	wow,	it	is	not	going	to	be	pretty	or	pleasant.
So	that	marathon	—	despite	how	ridiculously	 painful	and	difficult	it	is	—	will
only	give	someone	some	good	exercise	once,	not	as	a	habit.

If	 that’s	 it	 and	 they	 never	 exercise	 again,	 then	 they’re	 going	 to	 revert	 back	 to
their	old,	out-of-shape	selves.

The	same	is	true	with	our	fears.

The	 way	 to	 attack	 anxieties	 is	 through	 incremental,	 consistent	 exposure.	 Not
single,	extreme	exposure.

So	for	instance,	you	could	take	an	afternoon	or	your	lunch	break	each	day	and
make	a	point	to	approach	a	few	women	just	asking	for	the	time.

Nothing	more	is	required,	just	ask	what	time	it	is.

Find	 something	 easy,	 but	 repeat	 it	 regularly	 for	 a	 while,	 until	 it	 doesn’t	 feel
difficult	anymore.

Then	 the	 next	 week,	 you	 go	 out	 and	 ask	 women	 what	 time	 it	 is	 followed	 by,
“How	is	your	day	going?”

And	each	day,	you	slowly	make	it	harder	and	more	intensive.

Slowly	work	up	until	you’re	able	to	approach	women	by	telling	them	you	think
they’re	attractive	and	asking	them	out	on	a	date.	You’ll	be	surprised	how	quickly
you	can	get	comfortable	doing	this.

In	fact,	if	you’re	like	most	guys	and	stick	with	it,	then	you’ll	begin	to	get	hooked
to	 the	 adrenaline	 rush	 and	 actually	 enjoy	 the	 butterflies	 you	 get	 when	 you
approach	a	new	woman.

Eventually,	 you’ll	 be	 able	 to	 approach	 any	 woman	 in	 any	 circumstance	 and
express	your	interest	in	her	without	fear,	without	worrying	about	what	to	say	or
what	line	to	use.

And	you	can	apply	this	to	all	sorts	of	situations:	getting	physical	with	women,
emailing	 women	 online,	 calling	 phone	 numbers,	 sexual	 humor,	 conversations
with	women,	etc.,	etc.

It’s	just	a	matter	of	knowing	how	to	structure	your	exposure.

Afraid	to	kiss	girls	on	a	date?	Challenge	yourself	first	to	hold	their	hand.	Once
you’ve	 done	 that	 a	 few	 times,	 then	 challenge	 yourself	 to	 put	 your	 arm	 around
them	 and	 leave	 it	 there.	 Once	 you’ve	 done	 that	 a	 few	 times,	 then	 challenge
yourself	to	kiss	them	on	the	cheek.	And	finally,	challenge	yourself	to	go	for	the
kiss	itself.

All	of	these	goals	can	be	done	with	the	same	girl,	and	even	on	the	same	date.	But
the	important	part	is	to	stair-step	your	approach	rather	than	expecting	yourself	to
immediately	be	banging	girls	by	the	dozen	after	a	week.

Get	creative.	Other	sticking	points	this	method	can	be	applied	to:

-	Stalling	out	in	conversation.	Being	comfortable	talking	about	yourself.
-	Calling	girls	and	asking	them	out	on	dates.
-	Going	for	sex	once	you’ve	been	out	on	a	date	with	a	girl.
-	Flirting	and	teasing	women.
-	Showing	direct	interest.	Stating	that	you’re	attracted	to	them.

Really	all	it	takes	is	a	focused	and	concerted	effort	on	your	part	without	actually
expecting	yourself	to	go	from	0	to	100	in	one	night.	Instead,	you’ll	slowly	but
surely	 gain	 little	 successes	 repeatedly,	 not	 only	 building	 your	 competence	 and
confidence	 but	 also	 making	 the	 whole	 process	 a	 lot	 more	 enjoyable,	 therefore
helping	you	get	over	your	anxiety.

And	 the	 great	 thing	 about	 this	 method	 is	 that	 as	 you	 get	 accustomed	 to	 your
anxiety	and	become	more	confident	in	your	ability,	you’ll	be	more	motivated	to

meet	 and	 date	 even	 more	 women,	 increasing	 your	 confidence	 and	 competence
further,	and	easing	your	anxiety	that	much	more.

There’s	momentum	to	it,	which	is	absolutely	integral	to	developing	a	healthy	and
successful	love	life.

The	 last	 thing	 I’ll	 say	 about	 this	 method	 before	 moving	 on	 is	 that	 you	 should
only	focus	on	one	thing	at	a	time.	And	when	I	say	“focus”	on	one	thing	at	a	time,
I	really	mean	only	quantify	one	aspect	of	your	interactions	at	a	time.

So	 if	 you	 want	 to	 be	 less	 nervous	 approaching	 women,	 don’t	 bother	 yourself
worrying	 about	 how	 to	 get	 phone	 numbers	 or	 when	 to	 go	 for	 the	 kiss	 or	 what
texts	you	should	be	writing.	Just	focus	on	approaching.

But	by	the	same	token,	when	you’re	focusing	on	getting	physical	and	assertive
with	women,	don’t	worry	about	approaching.	A	very	common	form	of	avoidance
for	men	who	are	terrified	of	“later	stage”	parts	of	dating	women	—	escalating,
dates,	sex,	etc.	—	is	that	they’ll	actually	use	approaching	more	women	as	a	form
of	 avoidance.	 They’ll	 have	 a	 beautiful	 woman	 totally	 enrapt	 with	 them,	 and
instead	 of	 seeing	 how	 far	 they	 can	 push	 things,	 they’ll	 take	 her	 number	 and
move	 on,	 because	 they	 tell	 themselves	 they	 want	 to	 keep	 “working	 on
approaches.”	 When	 approaching	 is	 not	 their	 problem.	 Getting	 sexual	 with
women	is!

Again,	some	self-awareness	is	critical.	Take	things	one	at	a	time,	stair-step	them
slowly	until	you	get	not	only	comfortable	with	it,	but	excited	about	it,	and	then
move	on	to	the	next	thing.	That	excitement	and	enthusiasm	will	bleed	over	into
the	next	form	of	anxiety	and	motivate	you	to	keep	going.

If	this	sounds	like	a	lot	of	work,	it’s	actually	not.	It’s	actually	way	less	work.	If
you	 are	 afraid	 of	 meeting	 women,	 then	 it	 means	 just	 starting	 with	 the	 simplest
step:	ask	for	the	time,	join	a	dating	site,	ask	a	friend	to	introduce	you.	And	then
take	 it	one	step	at	a	 time,	each	step	challenging	yourself	to	do	a	bit	more	than
before.	 It’s	 actually	 quite	 simple	 and	 if	 you’re	 focused	 about	 it	 and	 don’t	 get
distracted	 with	 all	 sorts	 of	 mundane	 and	 extraneous	 theory,	 it’s	 very
straightforward	and	can	be	accomplished	quickly.

Courage	and	Boldness

Feeling	 fear	 and	 acting	 despite	 it	 builds	 courage.	 Anytime	 you’re	 afraid	 to	 do
something	and	feel	some	invisible	force	holding	you	back,	yet	you	push	through
it	anyway,	you’re	building	courage	within	yourself.

Courage	 is	 a	 habit.	 Courage	 is	 a	 form	 of	 discipline.	 It’s	 taking	 a	 certain	 action
even	 though	 you	 feel	 like	 doing	 something	 else.	 The	 difference	 here	 is	 that
courage	involves	acting	against	fear,	whereas	discipline	involves	acting	against
laziness	or	fatigue.

Courage	is	built	like	a	muscle.	The	stair-stepped	exercises	in	the	previous	section
are	designed	to	progressively	build	your	courage.	The	more	courage	you	build,
the	 more	 you’ll	 be	 capable	 of	 bold	 actions.	 Bold	 actions	 require	 a	 lot	 of
vulnerability	and	build	non-neediness.

Stopping	a	woman	and	asking	her	for	the	time	requires	little	courage	and	is	not	a
bold	action.	It’s	well	within	social	norms.

Walking	 up	 to	 a	 group	 of	 six	 people	 sitting	 down,	 asking	 to	 speak	 to	 the	 most
attractive	woman	for	a	moment,	telling	her	that	you	find	her	beautiful	and	you’d
like	to	take	her	out	sometime,	is	quite	bold.	It’s	bold	because	it	requires	a	lot	of
courage	to	disrupt	social	norms	and	it	requires	quite	a	bit	of	vulnerability.

But	there’s	a	caveat	here.	You	must	know	that	you’re	interrupting	social	norms.
You	must	acknowledge	that	what	you	are	doing	is	unusual.	If	you	don’t,	you’ll
be	seen	as	someone	who	is	out	of	touch	and	oblivious,	which	is	not	attractive.

This	 is	 a	 common	 mistake	 that	 many	 of	 the	 Social	 Disconnect	 types	 of	 men
make.	 Since	 they’re	 so	 out	 of	 tune	 with	 social	 norms,	 they	 often	 have	 no
problem	 behaving	 in	 a	 bold	 way.	 The	 problem	 is,	 they	 aren’t	 aware	 of	 when
they’re	being	bold	or	not.

For	instance,	I	once	worked	with	a	guy	who	was	very	socially	disconnected.	We
were	in	a	shopping	mall	and	we	were	walking	around	talking	to	women	together.

As	we	were	going	down	an	escalator,	we	saw	a	very	attractive	girl	going	up	the
up	 escalator	 on	 the	 other	 side.	 As	 we	 passed	 her	 I	 mentioned	 to	 him	 that	 he
should	talk	to	her.

He	immediately	began	running	up	the	down	escalator	and	shouting	to	her	trying
to	introduce	himself.

Obviously,	 this	 is	 a	 very	 awkward	 and	 strange	 thing	 to	 do.	 And	 had	 he	 been
aware	 of	 how	 awkward	 and	 strange	 it	 was,	 he	 would	 have	 been	 bold.	 But
instead,	he	was	just	unaware,	and	as	such	he	immediately	creeped	the	girl	out.

This	is	why	if	you’re	ever	going	to	do	something	that	is	unusual	—	approach	a
woman	in	a	strange	location,	try	to	kiss	her	in	a	strange	location,	invite	her	out
with	you	after	just	meeting	her,	etc.	—	it’s	important	that	you	communicate	that
you	realize	what	you’re	doing	is	abnormal.

“You	know,	I’ve	never	done	this	before,	and	I	know	we	just	met,	but	why	don’t
you	come	to	the	restaurant	with	me?”

“Excuse	me,	this	is	kind	of	random,	but	I	thought	you	were	cute	and	wanted	to
meet	you.”

The	bolder	your	action,	the	greater	attraction	you’re	going	to	create.	The	bolder
the	 action,	 the	 more	 vulnerability	 you	 show,	 and	 the	 more	 you	 polarize
responses.

If	 you	 walk	 around	 and	 ask	 women	 for	 the	 time,	 you	 are	 not	 polarizing	 them
very	much.	Most	of	them	will	give	you	the	time.	The	worst	rejection	you’ll	ever
get	may	be,	“Oh	sorry,	I	don’t	have	a	watch,”	or	something	similar.

But	if	you	walk	around	and	ask	women	on	dates,	you’re	going	to	get	polarized
reactions	—	nervous	and	excited	yes’s,	and	tense	and	reserved	no’s.	Or	maybe	a
few	angry	no’s.	If	you	go	even	further	and	try	to	kiss	a	woman	at	an	unexpected
time,	you’re	either	going	to	get	a	very	enthusiastic	yes	or	an	enthusiastic	no.

The	point	is:	greater	boldness	leads	to	greater	polarization.

This	 is	 yet	 another	 argument	 for	 behaving	 in	 an	 assertive	 manner.	 This	 is	 also
why	 one	 of	 my	 mantras	 that	 I	 tell	 men	 is,	 “Always	 err	 on	 the	 side	 of
assertiveness.”

Whenever	 you’re	 in	 doubt	 of	 what	 you	 should	 do,	 err	 on	 the	 side	 of
assertiveness.	Choose	the	bolder	action.	Because	if	you	wait	around	for	the	safer
and	less	bold	opportunity	to	make	a	move	on	her,	chances	are	the	attraction	will
be	less	or	may	even	dwindle.

But	 bold	 behavior	 by	 itself	 will	 only	 go	 so	 far.	 Boldness	 must	 be	 molded	 by

charismatic	 and	 efficient	 communication.	 Just	 behaving	 recklessly	 and	 will
attract	some	women	to	you,	and	will	give	you	sexual	opportunities	(particularly
in	 party	 environments),	 but	 without	 communicating	 in	 a	 charming	 and
interesting	manner,	and	without	being	aware	of	social	norms,	it’s	unlikely	you’ll
get	 many	 women	 to	 stick	 around,	 and	 your	 relationships	 will	 not	 be	 that
enjoyable.

You	 can	 build	 up	 an	 incredibly	 attractive	 lifestyle	 and	 persona,	 focus	 on	 the
proper	demographic,	act	boldly	and	pursue	women	shamelessly,	but	if	you	can’t
communicate	to	them	your	intentions	and	your	personality	well,	then	it	will	be
hard	to	maintain	their	interest	for	very	long.

The	fifth	part	will	cover	how	to	revamp	your	communication	and	how	to	make
good	impressions	upon	everyone	you	meet.

Part	V:	Honest	Communication

Chapter	11:
Your	Intentions

All	 the	 way	 back	 in	 Chapter	 3,	 we	 talked	 about	 how	 vulnerability	 only	 holds
weight	 when	 it’s	 communicated	 unconditionally	 —	 that	 is,	 when	 you
compliment	 a	 woman	 or	 express	 yourself,	 you’re	 not	 doing	 it	 with	 an	 ulterior
motive,	you’re	simply	expressing	yourself.

In	this	chapter,	I’d	like	to	take	that	idea	further.

Men	 mostly	 communicate	 through	 facts,	 stories,	 and	 data.	 We	 discuss	 sports
statistics,	how	we	fixed	our	car	last	weekend,	and	where	we	plan	on	going	next
month.	If	a	man	says,	“I’ll	see	you	at	6	PM,”	he	typically	means	it	literally.	If	a
man	tells	you	that	he	used	to	be	the	best	basketball	player	at	his	college,	you	take
it	 at	 face	 value,	 even	 if	 he	 may	 be	 exaggerating	 a	 little	 bit.	 If	 a	 man	 says	 he
dislikes	you,	then	it	means	he’s	not	your	friend	anymore	and	you	move	on.

Women	 communicate	 more	 in	 feelings	 and,	 more	 specifically,	 through
intentions.	 Sure,	 they	 still	 pay	 attention	 to	 the	 facts	 and	 stories	 on	 the	 surface,
but	 what’s	 actually	 communicated	 to	 them	 is	 the	 intention	 and	 feeling
underneath.

This	is	sub-communication.

This	 is	 why	 your	 girlfriend	 can	 get	 upset	 and	 tell	 you	 she	 hates	 it	 when	 you
spend	time	with	your	friends	one	night,	and	then	the	next	night	she	insists	you	go
to	your	weekly	bowling	league	and	not	see	any	contradiction	in	her	statements.
On	the	first	night,	she	felt	like	you	weren’t	paying	enough	attention	to	her.	On
the	second,	she	felt	secure	with	you	and	wants	you	to	be	happy.	The	issue	wasn’t
actually	your	friends,	it	was	simply	her	feeling	valued.

Needless	to	say,	this	sort	of	stuff	often	confuses	the	hell	out	of	men,	often	for	an
entire	lifetime.

This	is	why	men	often	refer	women	to	“crazy,”	“irrational”	or	“unstable.”

The	 fact	 that	 men	 are	 oblivious	 to	 the	 emotions	 and	 intentions	 that	 underline
everything	women	say	often	makes	women	feel	like	men	are	“heartless,”	“cold,"

"assholes,”	“selfish	jerks,”	or	that	they	“don’t	listen.”

We	listen,	we’re	just	usually	playing	in	the	shallow	end	of	the	pool.

In	Chapter	3,	I	told	the	story	of	the	time	my	friend	walked	around	asking	women
if	 he	 could	 pee	 in	 their	 butt.	 Obviously,	 his	 words	 were	 absolutely	 ridiculous,
and	all	of	the	women	he	approached	—	both	the	ones	who	rejected	him	and	the
one	he	went	home	with	—	didn’t	give	his	words	much	credit.

But	his	intention	was	loud	and	clear:	I	don’t	care	what	you	think,	I	want	to	have
fun	 tonight,	 and	 my	 idea	 of	 fun	 is	 a	 little	 extreme	 because	 I’m	 extreme.
Obviously,	this	 scared	a	 few	women	off.	But	once	he	found	 one	who	liked	his
intentions,	she	latched	on	quickly	and	hard.

That’s	an	extreme	example,	but	here’s	another,	much	more	common	example.

Some	dating	advice	tells	men	not	to	compliment	a	woman	too	early	or	too	often.
The	 reason	 for	 this	 is	 that	 most	 men	 who	 read	 dating	 advice	 have	 poor
intentions:	 they’re	 needy	 and	 looking	 to	 validate	 themselves	 through	 sex	 or
female	 affection.	 So	 when	 a	 man	 compliments	 a	 woman	 out	 of	 neediness,	 it’s
going	to	make	a	woman	feel	uncomfortable	and	objectified.

Now	if	a	man	compliments	a	woman	out	of	genuine	appreciation	for	her,	she’s
going	to	hear	his	intention	and	be	genuinely	appreciative	of	him	as	well.

Teasing	 and	 flirting	 with	 women	 is	 another	 great	 example.	 Many	 men,	 when
they	first	begin	trying	to	flirt	with	women,	will	tease	them	or	“neg”	them.	Ask
yourself	 this,	 what’s	 the	 difference	 between	 a	 tease	 and	 an	 insult?	 Both	 are
derogatory	statements.	Both	often	incorporate	humor.	So	what’s	the	difference?

Intention.	Teasing	is	done	with	a	fun	and	positive	intention.	Insults	are	done	with
a	negative	intention.

Or	what’s	the	difference	between	sharing	yourself	and	bragging?	Let’s	say	you
are	 friends	 with	 a	 celebrity.	 What’s	 the	 difference	 between	 sharing	 your	 life
experience	with	a	woman	(attractive)	and	bragging	to	her	(unattractive)?

Hopefully,	you’re	catching	on	by	now:	it’s	intention.	What	is	your	intention?	Are
you	 trying	 to	 impress	 her	 (needy)	 and	 therefore	 bragging?	 Or	 are	 you	 sharing
yourself	(vulnerability)	and	therefore	polarizing	her?

This	 relates	 directly	 back	 to	 what	 we	 talked	 about	 in	 Chapter	 1	 in	 regards	 to
investment,	neediness,	and	validation.	A	man	who	is	extremely	needy	will	have
intentions	 dominated	 by	 seeking	 validation	 and	 approval	 and	 will	 therefore	 be
unattractive	regardless	of	just	about	anything	he	says.	A	man	who	is	non-needy
will	 have	 intentions	dominated	by	vulnerability	and	will	therefore	be	attractive
regardless	of	what	he	says.

Obviously,	 there	 are	 technical	 considerations	 in	 how	 you	 communicate	 to
people,	 which	 we’ll	 cover	 throughout	 this	 chapter	 and	 the	 next.	 But	 the
overarching	point	is	that	what	you	actually	talk	about	has	far	less	influence	on
your	results	than	your	intentions.

Everything	 in	 this	 chapter	 and	 next	 assumes	 you	 are	 acting	 based	 on	 the	 right
intentions.	Remember,	women	don’t	see	your	features,	they	see	how	you	present
yourself.	 They	 don’t	 hear	 your	 words,	 they	 hear	 your	 intentions.	 If	 you	 suffer
from	chronic	rejection,	then	you	are	presenting	yourself	poorly	and/or	have	poor
intentions.	In	both	cases,	you’re	needy,	and	therefore,	you	will	always	be	seen	as
unattractive	until	you	are	able	to	invest	in	yourself.

Creepiness

The	number	one	fear	deterring	men	from	openly	expressing	their	sexual	desires
towards	women	is	a	fear	of	being	perceived	as	“creepy.”

Before	 we	 jump	 into	 what	 creepiness	 is	 exactly,	 and	 what	 women	 mean	 when
they	complain	about	it,	I	need	to	give	the	same	type	of	painful-truth	serum	I	gave
for	rejection:

There’s	no	such	thing	as	a	man	who	is	adored	by	women	who	isn’t	also	creepy
some	of	the	time.

The	fact	of	life	is	that	if	you	are	a	man	who	expresses	his	sexuality	freely	(and
you	should),	some	women,	some	of	the	time,	are	going	to	find	you	creepy.	It’s
simply	unavoidable.	No	matter	how	cool,	rich,	good-looking	and	charming	you
are,	at	some	point,	somewhere	a	woman	is	going	to	be	creeped	out	by	you.	Live
with	it.

So	 as	 a	 wise	 friend	 of	 mine	 sometimes	 says,	 “Give	 yourself	 permission	 to	 be
creepy.”	 Don’t	 try	 to	 be	 creepy.	 And	 definitely	 don’t	 walk	 around	 looking	 to

intimidate	 women.	 Simply	 accept	 that	 sometimes,	 miscommunications	 happen,
awkward	situations	occur,	and	things	get	misconstrued.	Such	is	life.	As	long	as
you’re	 respectful	 in	 how	 you	 express	 yourself,	 there	 should	 never	 be	 a	 serious
problem.

There’s	no	other	way.	And	look,	it’s	not	the	end	of	the	world.	There’s	no	Creepy
Police	who	come	and	handcuff	you	and	throw	you	in	Creep	prison	where	you’ll
wait	 for	 you	 court	 date	 where	 you’re	 charged	 for	 being	 creepy	 in	 the	 third
degree.

Creepiness	is	one	of	these	vague	concepts	that	everyone	knows,	but	no	one	can
really	 put	 into	 words.	 If	 you	 ask	 women	 what	 creepiness	 is,	 they’ll	 give	 you
roundabout	 answers	 and	 inevitably	 fall	 into	 examples	 of	 creepiness	 rather	 than
an	actual	definition.

Of	course,	their	examples	are	all	over	the	map	and	seem	to	have	absolutely	no
rhyme	or	reason	to	them.

(For	 what	 it’s	 worth,	 I	 asked	 a	 bunch	 of	 female	 friends	 this	 question	 and	 I	 got
answers	with	examples	of	creepiness	that	spanned	from	“he	had	dainty	hands”	to
“he	 grabbed	 me	 really	 hard	 on	 the	 arm	 for	 no	 reason,”	 to	 “putting	 too	 many
smileys	in	text	messages,”	to	“he	looks	at	you	in	a	funny	way	when	he	talks.”	As
is	 often	 the	 case,	 women	 are	 terrible	 authorities	 on	 why	 they	 like/dislike
something,	all	they	know	is	that	they	like/dislike	it.)

So,	at	the	risk	of	sounding	like	a	creep,	allow	me	throw	my	hat	in	the	ring	and
actually	give	a	concrete	definition	for	the	phenomenon:

Creepiness	is	behaving	in	a	way	that	makes	a	woman	feel	insecure	sexually.

The	further	you	get	out	of	line	with	your	intentions,	the	more	distrustful	she	will
be	of	your	actions	and	words.	And	the	more	distrustful	she	is,	the	more	insecure
she	 will	 feel	 and	 the	 creepier	 you	 become.	 For	 instance,	 if	 you	 approach	 a
woman	and	stand	there	and	talk	about	the	weather,	but	you’re	staring	at	her	rack
the	 whole	 time	 while	 licking	 your	 lips,	 then	 you	 will	 come	 across	 as	 creepy.
Your	actions	and	words	are	completely	out	of	line	with	your	intentions	and	she
can	see	that.

Even	if	you	tell	her	honestly,	“You	have	great	tits,”	you	will	be	creepy.	Not	for
lack	 of	 intention,	 but	 because	 she	 doesn’t	 know	 you	 and	 most	 women	 are	 not

comfortable	being	sexual	around	men	they	don’t	know.	Trust	takes	time.	She	has
to	 see	 that	 your	 actions	 line	 up	 with	 your	 intentions	 before	 she	 can	 feel
comfortable	exposing	herself	to	you	and	making	herself	vulnerable.

Women	 have	 a	 lot	 more	 to	 lose	 from	 expressing	 their	 sexuality	 than	 men	 do.
They	 make	 babies.	 We	 don’t.	 They	 get	 raped	 and/or	 sexually	 assaulted	 at	 a
startlingly	high	rate.	We	don’t.	They	have	five	thousands	years	of	sexist	cultural
history	making	them	feel	like	a	slut.	We	don’t.

The	 second	 you	 make	 them	 feel	 uncomfortable	 sexually	 is	 the	 second	 you
become	a	creep	and	the	second	she’s	finding	an	excuse	to	get	away	from	you	as
fast	as	she	can.

This	 is	 why	 vulnerability	 is	 so	 huge.	 When	 you’re	 vulnerable	 around	 someone
you	 don’t	 know,	 it	 elicits	 trust	 in	 them	 and	 they	 will	 become	 more	 vulnerable
toward	you	in	return.	The	more	vulnerable	a	woman	is	willing	to	be	around	you,
the	less	likely	you	will	be	to	creep	her	out.

(Caveat	1:	Vulnerability	is	still	subject	to	the	right	intentions.	If	you	tell	a	girl	a
sob	story	for	no	other	reason	than	to	get	her	to	feel	sorry	for	you	and	sleep	with
you,	then	guess	what,	you’re	still	creepy!)

(Caveat	2:	Sex	can	be	viewed	as	the	ultimate	act	of	vulnerability	for	a	woman.
The	 more	 vulnerable	 you	 make	 yourself	 around	 her	 —	 by	 leading,	 by	 sharing
your	 intentions,	 by	 being	 honest	 —	 the	 more	 she	 will	 trust	 you	 and	 become
vulnerable	in	return.	Sex	is	a	side	effect	of	that	mutual	vulnerability.)

Paradoxically,	 the	 way	 to	 interact	 with	 women	 in	 a	 vulnerable	 way	 and,
therefore,	the	way	to	combat	creepiness,	is	to	accept	that	some	women	will	find
you	creepy	some	of	the	time.	Just	as	with	rejection,	the	more	you’re	willing	to
risk	it,	the	less	it	will	happen.

The	 more	 comfortable	 you	 are	 with	 women	 finding	 you	 creepy,	 and	 the	 more
uninhibited	 and	vulnerable	your	actions	and	 words	 are	around	women,	and	the
more	aware	and	respectful	you	are	of	their	interests	and	desires,	the	less	likely
they	will	be	to	find	you	creepy.	The	more	reserved	and	closed	up	you	are	about
your	intentions,	the	more	you	attempt	to	manipulate	her	and	mislead	her	about
what	you	want	and	who	you	are,	the	more	you	disregard	her	feelings	and	actions
toward	you,	the	more	likely	you	are	to	become	creepy.

language,	 strange	 conversation

Obviously,	there	are	technical	aspects	of	communication	that	affect	this	as	well.
Bad	 body
topics,	 uncalibrated	 humor,
inappropriate	 touching	 —	 these	 things	 can	 all	 make	 you	 creepy	 even	 with	 the
best	of	intentions.	This	is	why	I	say	that	at	some	point	you	have	to	accept	that
you’re	going	to	creep	some	women	out	and	that’s	OK.	Because	the	alternative	is
to	hide	your	sexuality	and	hope	a	woman	comes	to	you	—	and	well,	we	all	know
how	well	that	works	out.

Sexual	Tension

Flirting	 is	 the	 opposite	 of	 creepiness.	 Flirting	 is	 expressing	 your	 sexuality	 in	 a
way	that	makes	a	woman	feel	sexually	secure.

Sometimes	 the	 sexuality	 of	 your	 behavior	 is	 overt,	 sometimes	 it’s	 subtle,
sometimes	 it’s	 implied.	 But	 when	 done	 correctly,	 it’s	 accepted	 and	 appreciated
by	women.

If	you	research	dating	advice	and	pick	up	tips,	you’ll	find	dozens	and	dozens	of
methods	 of	 “building	 attraction”	 with	 women.	 Some	 of	 the	 more	 popular	 ones
include	 teasing,	 bantering,	 negging,	 cocky/funny,	 push/pull,	 qualification,
statements	 of	 interest,	 false	 disqualifiers,	 roleplaying,	 leading	 and	 pacing,
eliciting	values,	magic	tricks,	cold-reading,	false	takeaways,	word	games,	hand
games,	betting	and	competition,	etc.

Chances	are,	you’ve	read	or	are	familiar	with	at	least	a	few	of	these	concepts.	If
you	don’t	know	what	most	of	them	are,	then	good,	don’t	worry	about	it.	No,	I’m
serious	—	don’t	worry	about	it,	because	they	all	follow	the	same	basic	pattern.

Flirting	 is	 expressing	 your	 sexuality	 to	 a	 woman	 in	 a	 way	 that	 makes	 her	 feel
secure	expressing	her	sexuality	back	towards	you.

In	 a	 nutshell,	 what	 a	 lot	 of	 men	 refer	 to	 as	 “game”	 is	 their	 ability	 to	 flirt	 with
women.	 How	 well	 can	 they	 express	 their	 sexuality	 to	 women	 with	 positive
responses?	If	they	can	do	it	often,	they	have	“game.”

The	 tactics	 or	 strategies	 used	 (teasing,	 etc.)	 all	 do	 this	 in	 their	 own	 ways,	 but
they	all	follow	the	same	pattern.	For	the	sake	of	time	and	space	(and	boredom),
I’ll	be	grouping	most	methods	of	flirting	into	two	different	groups:	teasing	and
boldness.	 Both	 teasing	 and	 bold	 types	 of	 flirting	 (whether	 it’s	 negging,	 false

takeaways,	 or	 roleplaying)	 follow	 the	 same	 basic	 formula:	 they	 all	 involve
breaking	rapport	in	order	to	generate	sexual	tension.

Scientific	 research	 shows	 that	 sexual	 tension	 builds	 when	 the	 uncertainty	 of
potential	sexual	possibilities	is	presented	in	an	interaction.

For	example,	if	I	say	something	with	implied	sexual	innuendo	like,	“Well,	that’s
cool	 you	 are	 into	 cats,	 maybe	 I	 can	 come	 over	 and	 play	 with	 your	 pussy	 for	 a
while,”	 this	 generates	 sexual	 tension	 because,	 assuming	 she	 doesn’t	 throw	 her
drink	in	my	face	or	slap	me,	it	leaves	the	possibility	of	a	future	sexual	encounter
on	 the	 table.	 It’s	 a	 story	 with	 no	 ending,	 the	 human	 brain	 wants	 to	 know	 what
happens	next.	And	in	this	case,	what	happens	next	is	probably	something	sexual.

type	 behaviors	 generate	 sexual

Teasing
they	 generate
uncertainty	 as	 to	 whether	 or	 not	 you’re	 actually	 interested	 in	 a	 woman.	 In	 the
example	above,	depending	on	the	context	and	situation,	I	could	be	totally	joking
and	being	facetious.	Or	I	could	be	totally	serious	and	masking	my	desires	behind
a	thinly-veiled	joke.	She	doesn’t	know.	And	that’s	what	makes	it	so	good.	The
uncertainty	generates	the	tension.

tension	 because

If	you	tease	a	woman	about	her	hair,	telling	her	she	looks	like	ET	with	a	perm,	or
that	 your	 grandmother	 once	 owned	 a	 wig	 like	 that,	 you	 accomplish	 sexual
tension	 because	 you	 are	 sending	 mixed	 signals.	 Your	 intentions	 are	 sending	 a
“Yes,	I	like	you,”	signal,	while	your	words	are	sending	a,	“No,	I	don’t,”	signal.
This	generates	uncertainty	and,	therefore,	sexual	tension.

This	 is	 why	 most	 dating	 advice	 in	 western	 culture,	 to	 both	 men	 and	 women,
encourages	you	to	send	mixed	messages,	“play	hard	to	get,”	or	play	games	with
one	 another.	 Sure,	 it	 distorts	 intentions,	 but	 it	 also	 generates	 uncertainty	 and
therefore,	sexual	tension.

But	one	can	flirt	by	being	clear	with	one’s	intentions	as	well.	One	can	state	one’s
sexual	 desires	 clearly	 or	 actually	 even	 move	 to	 make	 those	 sexual	 desires
happen.	It’s	counterintuitive,	but	this	can	generate	a	lot	of	uncertainty	and	sexual
tension	as	well.

For	 instance,	 let’s	 say	 you	 meet	 a	 woman	 and	 just	 come	 right	 out	 and	 say,	 “I
think	you’re	beautiful,	I’d	like	to	take	you	on	a	date.”

A	 lot	 of	 men	 cringe	 at	 this	 idea.	 Needy	 men	 hate	 it	 because	 they	 think	 it	 will

make	them	creepy.	Narcissistic	men	hate	it	because	they	believe	they’re	giving
their	power	away.

But	in	reality,	it’s	one	of	the	most	powerful	and	practical	things	you	can	say.	Not
only	 is	 it	 vulnerable,	 as	 we’ve	 discussed	 at	 length,	 but	 it	 also	 builds	 far	 more
sexual	tension.

But	how?	If	she	already	knows	you	like	her,	how	can	it	build	tension?	There’s	no
uncertainty.

Oh,	but	there	is.	It’s	just	not	immediately	obvious.	Observe:

1.	First	of	all,	a	direct	statement	like	that	is	polarizing.	So	if	a	woman	is	not
interested	in	you,	she	will	let	you	know	then	and	there.	If	she	is	interested
in	you,	this	bold	statement	will	make	her	so	excited	that	you	will	also	know
then	and	there.	Either	way,	you	win.

2.	Women	are	turned	on	by	being	desired,	remember?	They	are	aroused	by
men	who	perform	bold	behaviors	towards	them.	So	it	turns	her	on.

3.	 It	 also	 demonstrates	 that	 you	 are	 not	 needy,	 which	 makes	 you	 more
attractive	to	her.

4.	So	now	we	have	an	aroused	woman	who	is	interested,	and	an	attractive
man	 who	 is	 bold	 and	 vulnerable.	 And	 both	 have	 implicitly	 or	 explicitly
suggested	sexual	interest.	Suddenly	this	opens	up	all	sorts	of	new	questions
and	opportunities:	What	is	going	to	happen	next?	He’s	so	bold	and	direct,	I
have	no	idea	what	he’ll	say	or	do.	Does	he	want	to	kiss	me?	Does	he	want
to	fuck	me?	Do	I	want	to	fuck	him?	I	do	and	I	don’t.	I	don’t	know	what	to
do.	When	is	he	going	to	touch	me?	What	will	it	be	like?	Will	I	love	it?

See,	 if	 a	 man	 is	 having	 an	 innocuous	 conversation	 with	 a	 bunch	 of	 small	 talk,
there	is	never	any	uncertainty	in	the	woman’s	mind	as	to	where	things	stand.	The
conversation	is	shallow	and	simple	and	so	there’s	no	question	as	to	why	they’re
talking	or	the	significance	of	what	they’re	talking	about.

If	 a	 man	 begins	 to	 flirt	 with	 a	 woman	 by	 teasing	 her,	 then	 suddenly	 he	 adds	 a
new	 dimension	 by	 creating	 uncertainty:	 Does	 he	 like	 me	 or	 not?	 Why	 is	 he
flirting	with	me?

But	if	a	man	goes	the	bold	and	vulnerable	route,	and	is	willing	to	risk	rejection,
he	 is	 rewarded	 by	 creating	 massive	 amounts	 of	 sexual	 tension,	 because	 in	 a
single	 stroke	 you	 have	 transported	 the	 context	 away	 from,	 “What	 do	 we	 talk
about	next?”	to	“What	will	he	say	or	do	with	me	next?”

This	is	extremely	powerful.

Of	course,	this	is	often	easier	said	than	done.	Flirting	this	way	requires	showing
vulnerability,	risking	rejection,	and/or	potentially	being	creepy.	And	at	first,	you
may	 flirt	 in	 needy	 and	 supplicant	 ways,	 repelling	 women	 even	 faster	 than	 you
did	when	you	were	just	plain	and	boring.	But	eventually,	exposing	yourself	and
your	 sexual	 desires	 will	 force	 you	 to	 be	 less	 invested,	 more	 confident,	 more
dominant,	and	more	attractive.	The	teasing	will	help	by	creating	the	perception
of	non-neediness,	and	the	boldness	will	make	women	more	and	more	receptive
to	your	eventual	sexual	advances.

But	 unlike	 fears	 of	 living	 an	 attractive	 lifestyle,	 flirting	 and	 expressing	 your
sexuality	 requires	 communicating	 effectively.	 It	 requires	 competency	 at	 certain
social	 behaviors.	 And	 social	 behaviors,	 like	 any	 other	 kind	 of	 behavior,	 aren’t
simply	picked	up	overnight.	They	must	be	built	and	honed	through	practice.

Developing	an	Emotional	Connection

Your	 ability	 to	 connect	 with	 a	 woman	 emotionally	 is	 proportional	 to	 how	 self-
aware	you	are	of	your	own	emotional	processes	and	motivations.

As	 described	 in	 Chapter	 2,	 self-awareness	 and	 vulnerability	 will	 cause	 you	 to
behave	in	a	less	needy	manner,	they	give	her	the	chance	to	know	the	“real	you,”
to	trust	you,	and	to	open	her	own	emotions	up	to	you.

Ultimately,	 this	 is	 what	 most	 women	 want.	 If	 you	 look	 at	 romance	 novels	 —
basically	 the	 female	 version	 of	 porn	 —	 they	 all	 follow	 more	 or	 less	 the	 exact
same	 pattern:	 hard	 and	 rugged	 bad-boy	 type	 male	 hero	 is	 troubled	 but	 strong,
and	 as	 he	 slowly	 opens	 up	 and	 shares	 his	 true	 emotions	 and	 desires	 with	 the
heroine,	she’s	able	to	support	him,	to	save	him	and	ultimately	fall	in	love	with
him.	Of	course,	they	live	happily	ever	after.

This	 is	 more	 or	 less	 the	 blueprint	 of	 seduction:	 a	 strong,	 high	 status,	 attractive
exterior	 (lifestyle	 and	 looks),	 fearless,	 and	 able	 to	 open	 up	 and	 share	 your

vulnerable	side	with	her.	Women	get	weak	in	the	knees	for	this	shit.	And	it’s	not
even	conscious	most	of	the	time.

All	 that’s	 required	 is	 a	 certain	 level	 of	 emotional	 self-awareness	 and
vulnerability	in	your	interactions.

And	let	me	tell	you,	emotional	connections	are	powerful.	Far	more	powerful	than
any	 sort	 of	 tactics	 or	 tricks	 you	 may	 learn	 in	 other	 books.	 When	 you	 connect
with	 women	 emotionally,	 they	 really	 open	 up	 to	 you	 in	 ways	 that	 you	 can’t
imagine,	 your	 interactions	 and	 relationships	 with	 them	 become	 these	 rich	 and
unique	experiences	that	can	never	be	replicated,	the	sex	is	far	better,	and	all	mind
games,	flakes	and	ambivalence	goes	out	the	window.

A	lot	of	pick	up	and	dating	advice	is	what	I	call	“attraction	obsessed.”	It	has	a
constant,	 incessant	 harping	 on	 being	 the	 most	 attractive/alpha	 guy	 possible	 —
usually	by	employing	all	sorts	of	tricks,	games,	tactics,	techniques,	manipulation
and	 other	 falsehoods.	 Attraction	 obsession	 comes	 from	 a	 place	 of	 insecurity.	 It
seeks	validation.	It’s	needy	behavior	and,	therefore,	self-sabotaging	in	the	long
run.

It's	not	about	attraction.	She's	attracted	to	men	all	the	time	but	doesn't	sleep	with
any	 of	 them	 or	 date	 them.	 Women	 actually	 don't	 sleep	 with	 most	 men	 they're
attracted	to	because	they	would	feel	slutty	or	cheap.

Her	feeling	slutty	or	cheap	isn't	about	an	"Oh,	I	put	out	on	a	first	date,"	thing.	It's
not	 about	 number	 of	 dates,	 hours	 spent	 together,	 or	 how	 many	 dinners	 you
bought	her.

Feeling	slutty	is	about	sleeping	with	a	man	who	doesn't	care	about	her	or	who
hasn’t	connected	with	her.	If	she	doesn't	trust	you	or	isn't	100%	convinced	that
you	really	like	her	and	care	about	her,	then	she's	not	going	to	do	it.	And	if	she
does,	then	she’ll	regret	it	and	feel	dirty.

So	 how	 do	 you	 develop	 deep	 and	 lasting	 emotional	 connections	 with	 women,
connections	 that	 will	 blow	 your	 mind	 and	 heart	 away	 as	 well	 as	 hers	 too?
Connections	that	will	give	you	some	of	the	best	nights	and	sex	of	your	life?

Glad	you	asked.

Here’s	 the	 basic	 pattern,	 and	 you	 should	 recognize	 a	 lot	 of	 overlap	 here	 with

Chapter	2:

-	Becoming	aware	of	your	own	emotions,	motivations,	and	life	story.
-	 Taking	 the	 lead	 by	 sharing	 those	 emotions,	 motivations,	 and	 life	 story
first.
-	Sharing	first	creates	trust	and	encourages	her	to	open	up	and	share	herself
in	return.
-	Ideally,	the	more	this	goes	on,	the	more	personal	the	stories	become	and
the	deeper	the	emotions	are	by	which	you	connect.

For	 instance,	 take	 a	 simple	 conversation	 about	 music	 you	 two	 like.	 She	 likes
Empire	of	the	Sun.	You	like	Empire	of	the	Sun.	Instead	of	just	saying,	“I	really
like	Empire	of	the	Sun,”	you	can	expand	and	talk	about	why	you	like	Empire	of
the	Sun.

Instead	of	just,	“I	like	Empire	of	the	Sun,”	you	could	say,	“I	love	Empire	of	the
Sun.	 They	 always	 remind	 me	 of	 my	 brother.	 My	 brother	 used	 to	 drive	 me	 to
school	for	years,	and	he	would	blast	Empire	of	the	Sun	every	morning.	Looking
back,	it	meant	a	lot	to	me,	my	brother	taking	care	of	me	like	that.	My	dad	was
always	 too	 busy.	 So	 Empire	 of	 the	 Sun	 always	 reminds	 me	 of	 that.	 Those
moments	of	appreciation	that	you	don’t	recognize	until	years	later.”

Wow,	that’s	a	little	intense,	right?	That’s	the	idea.	If	you	feel	uncomfortable	just
reading	 that	 and	 imagining	 yourself	 saying	 something	 like	 it,	 then	 that’s	 good.
That’s	 vulnerability.	 And	 ultimately,	 that’s	 what’s	 going	 to	 make	 you	 an
attractive	man	who	can	emotionally	connect	with	women.

Things	can	go	even	deeper	as	well.	For	instance,	it’s	one	thing	to	talk	about	jobs.
Maybe	she’s	a	lawyer	and	came	from	a	poor	immigrant	background.	It	may	be
obvious	that	she	worked	very	hard	and	is	very	ambitious.	You	could	relate	to	that
by	 sharing	 how	 when	 you	 were	 a	 teenager,	 a	 couple	 of	 your	 best	 friends	 were
injured	 in	 a	 car	 accident	 and	 how	 that	 affected	 you,	 scared	 you	 straight,	 and
helped	 you	 become	 grateful	 for	 every	 day	 you	 have,	 how	 you	 started	 taking
advantage	of	your	time	and	potential	and	worked	very	hard	to	get	where	you	are.

Whatever	it	is,	open	up	about	it.	Challenge	yourself	to	go	one	level	deeper.

And	the	most	important	rule	of	emotional	connection	is	to	relate	to	feelings,	not
facts.	 Seduction	 is	 about	 feelings,	 not	 facts.	 This	 is	 why	 you	 can	 often	 meet	 a
woman	 who	 shares	 a	 lot	 in	 common	 with	 you	 —	 same	 home	 town,	 same

occupation,	same	interests,	lives	on	the	same	street	—	and	have	no	connection	or
chemistry	whatsoever.	But	then	you	can	meet	a	woman	who	has	lived	an	entirely
different	 life	 from	 you,	 but	 if	 you	 can	 relate	 to	 the	 emotional	 struggles	 and
emotional	realities	that	she’s	gone	through,	you	can	connect	deeply	with	her.

She	may	be	a	rich	girl	whose	father	died	when	she	was	eight	and	who	was	sent
to	boarding	school,	and	you	may	have	had	to	work	your	way	up	from	poverty	in
India	and	then	move	to	the	USA,	but	emotionally,	you	can	relate	very	deeply	—
the	alienation	from	home,	growing	up	with	no	sense	of	family	or	support	other
than	achievement,	feeling	isolated	by	your	talent.

loneliness,	 achievement,

Everybody	 on	 this	 planet	 shares	 a	 handful	 of	 universal	 emotional	 realities:
regret,	 hardship,
ambition,	 shame,	 alienation,
friendship,	 love,	 heartbreak.	 We’ve	 all	 experienced	 it.	 The	 facts	 change,	 the
feelings	are	the	same.	I	don’t	care	how	shallow	or	dumb	or	weird	or	annoying
she	is,	she	has	it	somewhere	in	her.	It’s	your	job	to	dig	it	out	and	connect	with	it.
That’s	 where	 the	 gold	 is.	 That’s	 where	 the	 real	 magic	 happens.	 Challenge
yourself	to	find	it.	Because	once	you	do,	you’ll	never	go	back.

And	the	biggest	misconception	about	generating	a	strong	emotional	connection
is	 that	 it	 obligates	 you	 to	 some	 sort	 of	 commitment.	 It	 doesn’t.	 Although	 it’s
more	 likely	 to	 cause	 you	 two	 to	 want	 to	 commit	 to	 one	 another,	 a	 relationship
commitment
intellectual	 construct,	 emotional	 connection	 happens
is	 an
organically	on	an	unconscious	level.

Be	 careful	 though,	 some	 women	 will	 feel	 cheated	 if	 you	 get	 too	 close	 to	 them
without	 following	 through	 on	 any	 sort	 of	 commitment.	 Our	 culture	 has
hammered	 it	 into	 women’s	 head	 that	 emotion	 equals	 commitment	 equals
happily-ever-after,	but	that’s	just	rarely	the	case.	So	make	sure	when	you	connect
with	women	on	a	deep	level,	they	can	handle	it	—	that	they’re	conscious	enough
to	 understand	 your	 expectations	 and	 that	 just	 because	 you	 feel	 a	 lot	 with	 each
other,	you’re	not	necessarily	obligated	to	one	another.

Building	and	Breaking	Habits

Your	 communication	 skills	 are	 a	 series	 of	 overlapping	 habits.	 You	 have	 habits
that	influence	when	and	how	you	make	eye	contact	with	people,	how	you	speak,
your	 voice	 inflections,	 what	 kinds	 of	 questions	 you	 ask,	 whether	 you	 lead	 the
conversation	 or	 follow,	 whether	 you’re	 curious	 about	 others	 or	 self-centered,

how	often	you	smile,	look	away	or	laugh.	The	list	goes	on	and	on.

If	 you	 have	 trouble	 relating	 to	 people,	 particularly	 women,	 then	 chances	 are
you’ve	developed	communication	habits	that	are	unattractive	and	are	not	serving
you	well.

Some	 of	 these	 habits	 are	 simple	 to	 learn	 and	 fix,	 such	 as	 making	 more	 eye
contact.	 Others	 are	 more	 difficult	 to	 notice	 and	 harder	 to	 fix,	 for	 instance
deferring	to	the	opinion	of	others	when	making	an	observation.

The	specific	habits	that	are	attractive	and	unattractive	will	be	covered	in	the	next
chapter.	But	for	now,	I	want	to	wrap	up	this	chapter	by	going	over	the	process	by
which	you	can	build	and	break	these	habits.

A	 lot	 of	 men	 get	 the	 wrong	 idea.	 They’ll	 read	 some	 dating	 advice	 saying
something	like,	“touch	her	on	the	arm	when	you	smile	at	her.”	Then	they’ll	go
out	and	do	it	and	it’ll	feel	very	awkward	and	stilted,	so	they’ll	never	do	it	again.

The	reason	it	feels	awkward	and	stilted	is	because	they’ve	never	done	it	before.
It’s	not	a	habit	for	them	yet.	In	fact,	not	touching	a	woman	when	they	smile	is	a
habit,	 and	 they’re	 trying	 to	 break	 it.	 Habits	 are	 hard	 to	 break.	 They	 take	 time.
And	you	have	to	do	them	repeatedly.

The	trick	is	to	identify	the	good/bad	habits	you	want	to	build	or	break	and	the
focus	on	them	consciously	until	they’re	second	nature.	This	actually	doesn’t	take
a	long	time.	For	simple	things	such	as	eye	contact	or	posture,	it	may	only	take	a
few	 weeks.	 For	 things	 such	 as	 touching,	 or	 making	 statements	 instead	 of
questions,	it	may	be	even	shorter.

Either	 way,	 the	 more	 you	 implement	 the	 habits,	 the	 better	 your	 reactions	 from
women	 will	 be,	 thereby	 increasing	 your	 motivation	 to	 implement	 the	 habits
further.

Basically,	what	I’m	saying	here,	is	that	everything	described	in	the	next	chapter
is	not	an	overnight	fix,	you	have	to	go	out	and	do	it	over	and	over	again.

And	just	as	with	desensitizing	yourself	to	your	anxieties,	you	want	to	focus	on
one	at	a	time,	two	at	the	most.

Another	 problem	 many	 men	 run	 into	 is	 that	 they	 learn	 that	 they	 need	 to	 make

strong	 eye	 contact,	 lean	 back	 on	 their	 back	 foot,	 touch	 on	 the	 approach,	 make
observations	 about	 her	 features,	 qualify	 her	 on	 her	 passions,	 smile	 when	 she
smiles	and	touch	her	when	she	laughs	all	at	the	same	time.

So	they	go	out,	and	get	completely	jumbled	up	and	don’t	know	what	to	focus	on
and	are	unable	to	focus	on	all	of	the	behaviors	at	the	same	time.

It	often	actually	makes	their	interactions	much	worse.

We	won’t	be	doing	that.	In	fact,	I	think	a	lot	of	the	tiny	habits	listed	above	are
overrated.	I’ll	be	presenting	attractive	social	habits	in	more	general	terms	so	that
1)	you	have	fewer	things	clogging	your	brain,	and	2)	there	will	still	be	room	to
express	your	personality	and	unique	ticks.

You’ll	 also	 notice	 that	 many	 of	 these	 habits	 are	 directly	 correlated	 with
overcoming	fears	and	anxieties	as	discussed	in	Chapters	9	and	10.	For	instance,
developing	the	habit	of	touching	a	woman	when	you	make	a	joke	relates	directly
to	an	anxiety	many	men	feel	about	showing	sexual	interest.	The	habit	of	smiling
when	you	introduce	yourself	to	somebody	ties	into	the	anxiety	of	meeting	new
people.

Many	of	these	behaviors	are	linked	to	your	anxieties.	And	the	interesting	thing	is
that	you	can	resolve	them	from	both	sides:	fixing	your	outer	behaviors	will	help
alleviate	your	internal	anxiety,	and	alleviating	your	internal	anxiety	will	help	fix
up	your	outer	behaviors.

As	 always,	 attractive	 social	 behaviors	 are	 rooted	 in	 a	 comfort	 with	 making
yourself	 vulnerable,	 an	 honest	 expression	 of	 your	 desires,	 and	 ultimately,
embodying	non-neediness	and	investing	in	yourself.

Chapter	12:
How	to	Improve	Your	Flirting

Sometimes,	 even	 if	 your	 intentions	 are	 in	 line	 and	 you’re	 expressing	 yourself
openly,	people	won’t	always	necessarily	perceive	you	correctly.	Communication
is	 always	 up	 for	 interpretation;	 therefore,	 there’s	 always	 going	 to	 be	 a	 chance
that	 you’ll	 be	 misunderstood	 or	 people	 might	 make	 incorrect	 judgments	 about
you.	 There’s	 also	 a	 good	 chance	 that	 you	 aren’t	 expressing	 yourself	 clearly	 or
effectively.

For	instance,	you	may	ask	a	girl	out	for	coffee.	But	perhaps	she’s	inexperienced
or	 comes	 from	 a	 conservative	 background,	 and	 so	 what	 is	 a	 clear	 statement	 of
interest	from	you,	appears	to	her	as	just	an	invitation	for	friendship.

Or	maybe	you	compliment	a	woman	on	her	dress.	But	for	whatever	reason,	your
tonality,	and	facial	expression	aren’t	clear	and	she	thinks	you’re	being	sarcastic.
Maybe	 she’s	 insecure	 and	 very	 touchy	 about	 men	 complimenting	 her,	 so	 she
responds	negatively.

In	the	long	run,	misunderstandings	and	miscommunications	are	unavoidable.	No
matter	how	clear	and	how	charming	you	are	there	are	always	going	to	be	women
who	misinterpret	what	you	say	to	them	as	well	as	your	intentions.	This	is	a	fact
of	life	and	something	you	have	to	get	used	to.

But	 what	 we	 can	 control	 is	 how	 efficiently	 and	 openly	 we	 communicate	 by
learning	clear	and	effective	communication	skills.	The	better	our	communication
skills,	the	more	clearly	we	can	express	ourselves	and	show	sexual	interest.	The
more	 clearly	 we	 express	 ourselves	 and	 show	 sexual	 interest,	 the	 more	 likely
we’ll	be	able	to	connect	with	women	in	a	sexual	and	emotional	way.

It’s	 sad	 but	 true.	 There	 are	 often	 situations	 where	 a	 woman	 will	 be	 sexually
interested	 in	 a	 man,	 but	 their	 failure	 to	 communicate	 their	 intentions	 to	 one
another	 clearly	 will	 derail	 the	 entire	 interaction.	 There’s	 no	 excuse	 to	 let	 this
happen.

And	as	with	all	of	the	Three	Fundamentals,	you’ll	find	that	clear	communication
will	 enhance	 other	 areas	 of	 your	 life	 —	 your	 professional	 relationships,	 your

family	relationships,	your	friendships,	your	networking	abilities	—	just	as	much
as	 it	 enhances	 your	 romantic	 relationships	 and	 your	 ability	 to	 meet	 and	 attract
women.

First	Impressions

First	 impressions	 are	 crucial.	 Studies	 show	 that	 we	 base	 the	 majority	 of	 our
perception	 of	 people	 on	 the	 first	 few	 minutes	 we	 spend	 with	 them.	 This	 initial
perception	can	extend	and	influence	our	relationship	to	the	person	for	weeks	or
even	months.

If	 I	 look	 at	 all	 of	 the	 women	 I’ve	 dated	 seriously,	 just	 about	 all	 of	 them	 (I’d
estimate	90%	or	so),	it	felt	“on”	within	the	first	few	minutes	of	the	interaction.
We	 clicked	 and	 that	 first	 impression	 led	 to	 a	 romantic	 and	 sexual	 relationship
further	down	the	line.

The	 biggest	 misconception	 about	 first	 impressions	 is	 being	 overly	 concerned
with	what	to	say	to	a	woman	when	you	meet	her.	What	you	say	to	her	when	you
first	meet	her	is	actually	unimportant,	and	hopefully	by	this	point	in	the	book,	I
don’t	have	to	explain	why.

The	exact	words	you	say	are	far	less	important	than	your	intentions	and	level	of
anxiety.

Ninety	 percent	 of	 the	 time	 when	 I	 meet	 a	 new	 woman,	 I	 simply	 say,	 “Hi,	 I’m
Mark.”	 I	 then	 follow	 it	 up	 with,	 “I	 wanted	 to	 meet	 you.”	 And	 if	 I’m	 feeling
particularly	bold,	I’ll	say,	“I	thought	you	were	cute	and	wanted	to	meet	you.”

That’s	it.

You	can	ask	a	woman	how	her	day	is	going,	or	say	the	most	perceptive	and	witty
thing	 to	 her	 in	 the	 first	 minutes,	 but	 her	 first	 impression	 is	 largely	 going	 to	 be
based	on	how	you	present	yourself	(looks/lifestyle;	Chapters	7	and	8),	your	level
of	anxiety	(anxiety;	Chapters	9	and	10),	and	your	ability	to	communicate	clearly.
What	actually	comes	out	of	your	mouth	is	going	to	be	forgotten	or	completely
irrelevant	within	seconds.

With	that	in	mind,	here	are	guidelines	for	making	a	good	first	impression:

-	 Do	 not	 startle	 or	 scare	 her	 when	 you	 approach	 her.	 This	 is	 possibly	 the
only	 death	 knell	 for	 approaching	 women.	 If	 you	 startle	 her	 or	 scare	 her
when	 she	 first	 meets	 you,	 in	 my	 experience,	 there	 is	 almost	 absolutely
nothing	 you	 can	 do	 to	 recover.	 You’re	 immediately	 labeled	 “creepy”	 and
she	will	do	anything	possible	to	get	out	of	the	situation.	Even	if	she’s	polite
and	talks	for	a	minute,	chances	are	she’s	never	going	to	open	up	and	trust
you.

Typical	 ways	 guys	 startle	 or	 scare	 women	 upon	 the	 approach	 are	 by
approaching	 them	 from	 behind	 (huge	 no-no),	 grabbing	 them	 violently,
screaming	at	them,	or	saying	something	offensive	or	weird.

-	 When	 in	 doubt	 on	 how	 to	 approach	 a	 woman,	 simply	 walk	 up	 and
introduce	yourself	and	explain	to	her	that	you	wanted	to	meet	her.	I	know
this	sounds	drab	and	boring.	But	remember,	it’s	not	about	entertaining	her;
it’s	 about	 being	 non-needy	 and	 expressing	 your	 genuine	 interest	 in	 her.
During	the	day,	I	often	 preface	 the	introduction	 by	saying	something	 like,
“Excuse	 me,	 this	 is	 kind	 of	 random...”	 Also	 during	 the	 day,	 I	 usually	 tell
them	that	I	think	they’re	cute.

In	my	experience,	the	fancier	and	more	creative	guys	try	to	get	 with	their
opening	 lines,	 the	 more	 likely	 they	 are	 to	 a)	 say	 something	 weird	 and	 b)
come	off	as	needy.	Think	about	it,	if	you	sit	around	for	10	minutes	trying	to
think	 of	 what	 to	 say	 to	 a	 girl	 so	 that	 she’ll	 like	 you,	 how	 is	 that	 ever	 not
needy?

She’ll	 sense	 this.	 In	 fact,	 it’s	 kind	 of	 amazing.	 Women	 really	 do	 seem	 to
have	a	sixth	sense	about	this	stuff.	I’ve	noticed	that	the	longer	I	hesitate	and
stare	at	a	girl	before	I	approach	her,	the	more	likely	I	am	to	be	rejected.	The
best	 approaches	 I	 ever	 do	 are	 when	 I	 don’t	 think	 about	 it	 and	 I
spontaneously	just	walk	up	and	say	hello.

-	Don’t	linger.	If	you	linger	and	hover	around	her,	it’s	almost	guaranteed	to
make	 the	 approach	 feel	 awkward	 and	 forced.	 Imagine	 a	 straight	 line
between	you	and	her,	and	when	you’re	ready	to	go,	follow	that	straight	line
until	you’re	standing	right	in	front	of	her.	Don’t	stand	around	and	kick	the
dirt	at	your	feet	trying	to	work	up	the	nerve	right	next	to	her.

-	Smile.	Always	smile.	Don’t	smile	like	the	Joker	from	the	Batman	movies
smiles.	But	smile	like	you’re	a	nice,	friendly	person.	A	comfortable	smile.
Lean	back.	Stand	up	tall.	Speak	loudly	yet	clearly.	Make	strong	eye	contact.
Introduce	yourself	and	stick	out	your	hand.	Give	a	firm	handshake.	This	is
called	being	a	confident	human	being.

If	you	are	getting	many	rejections	right	on	the	initial	approach,	then	it’s	one	of
the	following	three	things:

1.	 You’re	 presenting	 yourself	 poorly	 —	 i.e.,	 you	 dress	 poorly,	 bad	 looks,
bad	style,	bad	body	language.	Review	Chapters	7	and	8	again.

2.	Your	intentions	are	off.	You’re	approaching	for	the	wrong	reasons.	The
wrong	reasons	include	anything	that	is	not,	“She’s	cute.	I	want	to	meet	her.”
That	 means,	 approaching	 for	 statistics,	 approaching	 for	 "practice,”
approaching	to	impress	your	friends.	Approaching	because	you	want	to	live
up	 to	 a	 bunch	 of	 crap	 you	 read	 on	 the	 internet.	 These	 are	 all	 the	 wrong
reasons	 to	 approach.	 When	 you	 see	 a	 beautiful	 woman,	 you	 should	 be
motivated	 by	 nothing	 but	 your	 desire	 to	 get	 to	 know	 her.	 That’s	 it.	 If	 you
have	 trouble	 finding	 that	 motivation,	 refer	 back	 to	 the	 section	 on	 sexual
anxiety	in	Chapter	9.

3.	 You’re	 not	 following	 one	 of	 the	 guidelines	 above.	 You’re	 startling	 her.
You’re	 trying	 too	 hard	 to	 be	 clever	 or	 interesting.	 Or	 you’re	 doing
something	technically	wrong	(not	looking	her	in	the	eye,	not	smiling,	etc.)

Like	I	said,	if	you	have	everything	together,	you	should	not	be	getting	rejected
often	on	the	opener.	I’ve	coached	men	who	still	had	some	major	flaws	(lack	of
confidence,	 poor	 looks,	 anxiety),	 but	 having	 them	 follow	 the	 guidelines	 above
still	got	most	of	the	women	to	at	least	stop	and	talk	to	them	for	a	second.

And	really	that’s	all	the	opener	is	trying	to	do:	stop	them	and	get	them	to	talk	to
you	for	a	second.	It’s	your	conversation	skills	that	get	that	second	to	turn	into	a
minute	and	that	minute	to	turn	into	an	hour.

Conversation	Skills

Developing	conversation	skills	is	a	deep	topic,	and	for	the	sake	of	this	book,	I’m
only	going	to	gloss	over	the	most	important	aspects	and	the	advice	that’s	easiest

to	implement.

The	topics	that	we’ll	cover	in	this	section	are:

-	Using	effective	language
-	Questions	versus	statements
-	Creating	endless	conversation	topics
-	Storytelling
-	Basics	of	emotional	connection

Using	Effective	Language:	This	is	the	easiest	“quick	fix”	that	you	can	apply	to
your	 communication	 skills.	 Using	 effective	 language	 means	 saying	 what	 you
mean	with	the	fewest	words	possible	while	still	maintaining	your	meaning	and
intent.

This	 is	 where	 being	 a	 good	 writer	 can	 actually	 help	 you	 become	 a	 good
communicator.	If	you’re	saying	something	in	four	sentences	that	could	be	said	in
one,	say	it	in	one.	If	you	are	saying	something	in	ten	words	that	can	be	said	in
four,	say	it	in	four.

In	 conversation	 and	 communication	 quality	 always	 wins	 out	 over	 quantity.	 We
would	all	rather	have	30	seconds	of	amazing	communication	than	10	minutes	of
mediocre	communication	saying	the	same	thing.

It	also	means	removing	“um,”	“uh,”	“ah,”	“like,”	“you	know,”	and	other	fillers
from	your	everyday	speaking.

Removing	all	fillers	100%	of	the	time	is	often	impossible	(I	still	drop	an	“um,”
or	“you	know,”	occasionally),	but	the	more	of	these	you	remove,	the	more	clear
and	 coherent	 your	 speaking	 will	 be.	 Nothing	 screams	 a	 lack	 of	 sophistication
like	 somebody	 who	 sprinkles	 “like”	 and	 “umm”	 throughout	 his	 stories
constantly.
Read	the	following	two	sentences	out	loud:

“So,	um,	I	guess	what	I’m	saying	is	like,	that	I	never	really	felt	at	home	when	I
lived,	uh,	out	there,	you	know,	in	California.	The	people,	uh,	just	felt	kind	of	like,
superficial	to	me.	And	I,	um,	didn’t	like	really	like	it	a	whole	lot	I	guess.”

“I	never	really	felt	at	home	in	California.	The	people	felt	kind	of	superficial	to
me.	I	didn’t	really	like	it.”

Notice	 the	 difference	 in	 the	 two,	 notice	 how	 the	 second	 feels	 much	 more
impactful	and	to-the-point.

You	 don’t	 want	 to	 speak	 like	 a	 robot	 either.	 You	 can	 still	 use	 all	 of	 the
inflections,	 tonality	 and	 pacing	 on	 the	 second	 sentence	 without	 having	 to	 drop
“um”	and	“like”	all	the	time.

When	you	read	it,	you	should	be	able	to	feel	an	immediate	difference.	The	first
one	feels	very	casual,	lackadaisical,	even	lazy	and	uninterested.	The	second	one
feels	serious,	stern,	powerful,	and	clear.

Questions	versus	Statements:	Creating	threads	of	conversation	through	statement
is	 far	 more	 powerful	 than	 questions.	 This	 is	 because	 it	 assumes	 rapport	 and
instantly	makes	conversations	more	personally.

For	 instance,	 if	 you’ve	 been	 talking	 to	 a	 woman	 at	 a	 bar	 for	 a	 few	 minutes,
saying,	“I	love	olives	in	my	drink.	When	I	was	a	kid	I	used	to	eat	them	straight
out	of	the	jar,”	is	far	more	interesting	than,	“Do	you	like	olives	in	your	drink?”
and	waiting	for	her	response.	In	fact,	that	question	is	just	plain	weird.	But	that
statement	is	interesting,	and	what	many	women	would	consider	“cute.”

Instead	of	incessant	questioning,	you	want	to	develop	a	skill	called	cold	reading.
Cold	reading	is	a	skill	where	you’re	able	to	intuitively	“know”	something	about
someone	else	without	actually	knowing	it.

It’s	like	being	a	psychic	without	the	cheesiness.

For	 our	 purposes,	 cold	 reading	 is	 just	 a	 way	 of	 creating	 interesting	 statements
rather	 than	 asking	 questions	 for	 information.	 You	 don’t	 ask	 the	 question	 you
want	to	know,	but	instead,	you	make	a	mild	prediction.

Instead	 of	 asking	 her	 a	 question	 about	 herself,	 you	 guess	 the	 answer	 to	 your
question	and	then	state	it.	Here	are	some	examples:

“Where	are	you	from?”	translates	to:	“You	look	like	a	California	girl.”

“What	do	you	do	for	work?”	translates	to:	“You	seem	to	be	a	creative	person.	I
bet	your	job	is	interesting."

“How	do	you	guys	know	each	other?”	translates	to:	“You	guys	look	like	you’ve

been	friends	for	a	long	time.”

In	 each	 situation,	 the	 statement	 makes	 an	 educated	 guess	 and	 engages	 the
woman	 far	 more	 than	 any	 question	 will.	 Instead	 of	 asking	 her	 about	 herself,
you’re	 telling	 her	 about	 herself.	 The	 only	 thing	 people	 love	 more	 than	 talking
about	themselves	is	hearing	about	themselves.	But	what	if	you’re	wrong?

That’s	 the	 best	 part!	 A	 lot	 of	 guys	 worry	 about	 cold	 reading	 because	 they’re
afraid	 to	 state	 something	 incorrect.	 This	 is	 where	 human	 nature	 works	 in	 our
favor.

There’s	no	failing	with	cold	reading.	With	every	cold	read,	one	of	 three	things
will	happen:

1.	You’ll	be	wrong,	and	she’ll	correct	you.
2.	You’ll	be	wrong,	and	she’ll	ask	you	what	made	you	think	that.
3.	You’ll	be	right,	and	she’ll	freak	out	at	how	perceptive	you	are.

In	the	first	result,	she’ll	basically	just	answer	the	question	you	based	your	cold
read	on	and	forget	that	you	were	wrong.

In	the	second	result,	you’ll	be	wrong,	but	she’ll	be	so	intrigued	by	your	guess,
that	 she’ll	 create	 a	 deeper	 conversation	 thread	 about	 what	 you	 observed	 about
her.	Later	in	the	chapter,	we’ll	talk	about	the	importance	of	creating	the	deepest
threads	possible.

In	 the	 third	 result,	 the	 few	 times	 you	 get	 the	 cold	 read	 correct,	 she	 will	 most
likely	be	surprised	at	how	perceptive	you	are	about	her.	This	will	generate	a	tidal
wave	of	rapport	immediately	and	impress	her	at	the	same	time.

Here	are	examples	of	a	cold	read	situation	with	all	three	different	responses:

Me:	“You	look	a	bit	bookish.	You	must	be	a	student	around	here.”
Her:	“No,	I’m	not.	But	I	do	love	to	read,	though.”

Me:	“You	look	a	bit	bookish.	You	must	be	a	student	around	here.”
Her:	“No.	What	made	you	think	that?	Is	it	my	glasses?	I	just	got	them.”

Me:	“You	look	a	bit	bookish.	You	must	be	a	student	around	here.”
Her:	“Yeah,	I	am!	Wow,	is	it	that	obvious?”

You	 should	 cold	 read	 as	 much	 as	 possible.	 Any	 time	 you’re	 asking	 a	 question
that	requires	a	factual	answer,	take	a	stab	at	the	answer	instead	of	asking.

One	night,	I	met	a	girl	from	Chicago.	I	took	a	blind	guess	at	which	University
she	went	to	and	was	right.	She	couldn’t	get	over	“how	perceptive”	I	was	for	a
good	five	minutes.	She	asked	me	how	I	knew	and	I	told	her	I	could	tell	she	was
on	 the	 intellectual	 side	 although	 I	 figured	 she	 probably	 moved	 because	 the
school	 was	 located	 in	 a	 bad	 part	 of	 the	 city.	 Everything	 was	 dead-on	 despite
being	 educated	 guesses.	 From	 that	 point	 on,	 she	 engaged	 me	 completely	 in
conversation	and	was	more	than	excited	to	hang	out	with	me	again.

Besides	that,	creating	conversations	out	of	statements	protects	you	from	what	I
call	“blanking.”	You	know	when	you	are	talking	to	a	woman	and	all	the	sudden
the	 conversation	 dies	 and	 you	 have	 no	 idea	 what	 to	 say?	 You’re	 sitting	 there
awkwardly	and	the	more	uncomfortable	you	feel,	the	harder	it	is	to	come	up	with
something.	Eventually,	you	blurt	out	something	boring	like,	“So…	where	do	you
live?”

Using	 statements	 can	 prevent	 this	 a	 great	 deal.	 Instead	 of	 fishing	 for	 a	 new
conversation	 based	 on	 a	 generic	 question,	 you	 can	 simply	 comment	 about
something	 or	 observe	 something.	 Never	 underestimate	 the	 power	 of	 non-
sequiturs.

“I’m	 thinking	 about	 quitting	 drinking.”	 “A	 car	 almost	 hit	 me	 on	 the	 way	 here
tonight.”	 “My	 roommate	 eats	 peanut	 butter	 and	 mayonnaise	 sandwiches.	 It’s
disgusting.”	“I’ve	always	wanted	to	visit	Africa.”

These	 will	 sometimes	 come	 across	 as	 random.	 But	 that’s	 because	 they	 are	 —
they’re	whatever	thoughts	are	popping	into	your	head	at	the	moment.	It’s	better
to	be	random	and	interesting	than	predictable	and	boring.	Don’t	be	afraid	to	just
blurt	something	out.

This	works	because	unlike	questions,	statements	require	no	investment	from	the
other	person.	You	can	say	whatever	you	want	and	there’s	no	implicit	expectation
for	her	to	generate	conversation	as	well.

Speaking	in	statements	in	this	fashion	—	to	generate	spontaneous	conversation
—	is	important	in	that	it	forces	you	to	share	yourself	with	her.	When	you	simply
ask	 a	 girl	 questions,	 you	 aren’t	 giving	 any	 information	 about	 yourself,	 so	 it’s
harder	for	her	to	trust	you	or	build	rapport.	But	if	you	simply	state	a	fact	about

yourself	 and	 then	 talk	 about	 it,	 you	 are	 now	 sharing	 yourself	 and	giving	her	a
chance	to	chime	in	with	her	input	as	well.

The	amazing	thing	about	speaking	in	statements	is	if	you	do	it	correctly,	she	will
start	 asking	 you	 questions.	 This	 may	 not	 seem	 like	 a	 big	 deal,	 but	 it	 actually
reorients	 the	 entire	 interaction.	 As	 I	 mentioned	 earlier,	 whoever	 is	 asking	 the
questions	 is	 sub-communicating	 a	 desire	 to	 learn	 more	 about	 the	 other,	 i.e.,
interest,	 i.e.,	 they’re	 attracted	 to	 them.	 If	 she	 is	 constantly	 seeking	 information
from	you,	you	now	have	the	power	to	control	the	interaction	—	you	control	the
information	and	the	conversation.

Endless	Conversation	Topics:	In	every	topic	of	conversation,	there	are	countless
opportunities	 to	 jump	 off	 onto	 other	 topics	 —	 there	 are	 countless	 word
associations	to	be	made.

For	instance,	let’s	assume	you’re	talking	to	a	woman	and	she	says,	“I	never	liked
that	 restaurant.	 I	 went	 there	 on	 my	 birthday	 last	 year,	 and	 I	 don’t	 remember
anything	past	midnight.	I	woke	up	on	my	friend’s	kitchen	floor.”

This	is	loaded	with	opportunities	to	take	the	conversation	in	new	directions.	You
could	relate	and	talk	about	any	of	the	following:

1.	The	restaurant	she	doesn’t	like.
2.	What	you	did	on	your	last	birthday.
3.	The	last	time	you	got	black	out	drunk.
4.	A	story	about	waking	up	somewhere	unusual.

Any	and	all	of	these	topics	will	be	relevant	and	interesting	to	the	conversation.

If	you	don’t	already	do	this,	it’s	a	habit	you	need	to	ingrain	in	yourself	—	just	as
the	comedians	ingrain	off-the-wall	word	associations.

Here	 are	 a	 series	 of	 examples	 of	 statements	 that	 women	 may	 make.	 In	 them,	 I
have	underlined	the	“jump	off”	points.	Think	of	them	as	intersections	where	you
can	choose	which	direction	to	move	the	conversation.	As	you	read	through	these
examples,	try	to	come	up	with	a	statement	to	relate	to	each	jump	off	point.	This
will	help	teach	you	to	be	prepared	to	speak	about	any	topic	on	the	spot.

1.	 “I	 go	 to	 Harvard	 right	 now.	 But	 I	 want	 to	 move	 back	 out	 west.	 The

weather’s	too	cold	up	here.”

2.	“I’m	here	with	my	friends	Steve	and	Carrie.	They’ve	been	dating	for	six
months,	but	they	fight	like	a	married	couple.”

3.	 “We	 work	 together	 downtown	 in	 the	 district.	 It’s	 all	 right,	 but	 I’m
looking	to	change	careers.”

4.	“We	were	at	this	party	last	night.	It	was	crazy.	The	cops	ended	up	busting
it	and	some	drunken	kid	got	arrested.”

Try	 re-reading	 through	 these	 examples	 and	 at	 each	 underlined	 word	 or	 phrase,
try	to	immediately	come	up	with	a	thought	or	response	about	it.	For	example,	I
see	Harvard,	and	I	think	of	how	one	time	I	visited	there	and	their	campus	looks
like	 a	 palace.	 I	 also	 think	 of	 friends	 of	 mine	 who	 went	 to	 Harvard.	 These	 are
both	legitimate	places	to	take	the	conversation.

Once	you	become	competent	at	this,	you’ll	notice	that	this	is	the	way	in	which
every	 conversation	 flows.	 Conversations	 only	 end	 when	 one	 person	 says
something	 to	 which	 the	 other	 person	 has	 no	 jump	 off	 points.	 This	 is	 what
happens	when	a	conversation	“dies.”	If	you	teach	yourself	to	recognize	jump	off
points	and	take	advantage	of	them	as	soon	as	possible,	you’ll	be	able	to	sustain	a
conversation	with	almost	anybody	indefinitely.

Combine	this	skill	with	the	ability	to	cold	read	and	create	conversational	threads
out	of	thin	air	by	making	statements,	and	you	will	literally	develop	the	skill	to
begin	and	control	any	conversation	with	anybody	for	any	length	of	time.

Storytelling:	 Human	 beings,	 by	 default,	 are	 enrapt	 by	 stories,	 or	 more
specifically,	a	story	arc.	Politicians	use	them	to	campaign,	teachers	use	them	to
explain	important	concepts,	comedians	use	them	to	make	us	laugh,	and	we	use
them	constantly	in	our	day-to-day	interactions.

But	 what	 you	 probably	 didn’t	 notice	 is	 that	 the	 best	 communicators	 you	 know
are	fantastic	storytellers.

Have	you	ever	had	a	friend	who	would	start	telling	you	about	something	and	it
just	 seemed	 to	 go	 nowhere?	 Like,	 they’d	 start	 telling	 you	 about	 their	 trip	 to
Chicago	and	after	describing	the	hotel	and	maybe	mentioning	the	concierge,	the
story	just	died?

Or	 have	 you	 ever	 known	 someone	 who	 consistently	 makes	 jokes	 that	 don’t
completely	make	sense,	or	fizzle	out	and	aren’t	funny?

Or	 maybe	 you’re	 one	 of	 these	 people.	 Do	 people	 ever	 stop	 paying	 attention	 to
you	mid-story?	Or	do	you	have	trouble	making	others	laugh	(intentionally,	that
is)?

Chances	 are,	 these	 people	 (or	 you),	 aren’t	 following	 a	 strong	 story	 arc.	 For
whatever	 reason,	 humans	 have	 evolved	 to	 be	 absolutely	 fascinated	 when
information	is	communicated	in	a	certain	pattern.	This	is	true	of	just	about	any
culture	and	background.

There	are	three	main	points	of	a	story	arc:

Set	Up:	 The	 set	 up	 is	 exactly	 that:	 you’re	 setting	 the	 scene	 or	 the	 context	 for
what	 you’re	 about	 to	 say.	 It’s	 the	 foundation	 of	 what’s	 about	 to	 be	 told,	 and	 if
you	don’t	set	up	properly,	then	your	stories,	jokes,	and	ideas	will	always	seem	to
be	random.	People	will	consistently	comment	that	you’re	really	random,	weird,
or	“off	the	wall.”

Content/Conflict:	After	setting	up	what	you’re	going	to	talk	about,	you	get	into
the	actual	content.	This	can	also	be	the	“conflict”	in	your	story.	Whatever	it	is,
it’s	 something	 that	 causes	 tension	 and	 expectancy.	 The	 content	 of	 your	 story
needs	to	be	intriguing	and	hook	people	into	wanting	to	know	what	will	happen
next.	If	you	don’t	build	much	tension	with	the	content	of	your	stories,	you	will
find	people	losing	interest	or	get	the	feeling	like	you	ramble	on	a	lot.

Resolution:	 The	 resolution	 releases	 the	 tension	 from	 the	 conflict	 or	 content.
Resolutions	can	come	in	forms	of	punchlines	(for	jokes),	conclusions	(for	ideas),
or	 just	 closure	 for	 a	 generic	 story.	 People	 who	 don’t	 resolve	 their	 stories	 and
ideas	well	will	often	get	blank	stares	when	they’re	finished	speaking,	or	people
asking	them,	“Yeah,	and…?”	not	realizing	that	the	story	is	finished.

Here’s	an	example	of	a	story	with	a	setup,	content/conflict,	and	a	resolution:

When	I	was	in	college,	my	first	roommate	had	a	funny	habit	whenever	he
got	drunk.	He’d	basically	turn	into	a	narcoleptic	—	he’d	spontaneously	fall
asleep	in	strange	places	and	at	random	moments	(Setup).

Well,	 literally	 the	 first	 night	 I	 knew	 this	 guy,	 he	 and	 I	 go	 out	 to	 some

orientation	 party.	 We	 meet	 a	 couple	 girls	 and	 go	 back	 to	 their	 dorm	 with
them.	He	and	I	are	totally	drunk	and	I	notice	he’s	kind	of	stopped	talking	to
his	girl	and	is	dozing	off	in	the	corner.	Kind	of	weird,	but	it	was	like	3	AM,
so	whatever.	Suddenly,	he	says	he’s	going	to	go	and	gets	up	and	leaves.	I
think	nothing	of	it	until	I	go	home,	wake	up	the	next	morning	and	he’s	still
not	back.	Hours	pass	and	I	start	getting	worried	(Content/Conflict).

It	turns	out	that	the	guy	went	out	into	the	hallway	lobby,	laid	down	on	the
floor	and	slept	there	the	whole	night.	But	not	only	that,	he	left	his	jacket	in
the	girl’s	room.	So	at	like	9	in	the	morning	he	had	to	sneak	back	in,	wake
her	up	and	take	his	jacket	back.	It	was	pretty	hilarious	at	the	time.	But	yeah,
that	was	my	college	roommate	(Resolution).

Often	adding	a	line	like,	“Yeah,	that	was	my	college	roommate,”	is	good	because
it	indicates	that	the	story	is	finished	and	that	you’re	finished	speaking.

Here’s	another	example:

I	 knew	 I	 wasn’t	 meant	 for	 the	 9	 to	 5	 world	 almost	 immediately.	 Out	 of
college,	I	took	a	nice	job	at	a	prestigious	bank	in	downtown	Boston	(Setup).

I	hated	it	from	day	one.	In	fact,	I	remember	thinking	about	three	hours	into
the	first	day,	“I	wonder	how	long	I	have	to	work	here	before	I	can	leave?”
(Conflict/Content).

My	next	thought	was,	“This	is	probably	a	bad	sign.”	(Resolution).

Notice	that	I	allude	to	the	conclusion	in	the	beginning	of	my	story.	This	is	called
“foreshadowing”	and	often	helps	people	follow	along.	Also,	notice	that	it	really
doesn’t	matter	how	long	or	short	each	component	of	the	story	is	as	long	as	you
convey	the	correct	information.

Another	example:

When	most	people	talk	about	a	crazy	city,	I	don’t	think	they’ve	ever	been	to
South	America.	I	lived	down	there	for	a	few	months	last	Spring	and	you	see
things	every	week	that	are	just	beyond	our	reality	here	(Setup).

Like	 one	 night,	 we	 hopped	 in	 a	 cab	 to	 go	 to	 another	 nightclub.	 It	 was	 a
Tuesday	at	about	4	AM.	The	taxi	driver	promptly	turns	around	and	asks	us

if	 we’d	 like	 to	 try	 some	 of	 his	 cocaine.	 We	 politely	 refuse.	 So	 the	 cabbie
says	in	Spanish,	“Fine,	more	for	me.”	He	then	proceeds	to	do	lines	of	coke
while	driving	50mph	with	his	knees	(Content/Conflict).

We	all	thought	we	were	going	to	die	that	night	(Resolution).

All	true	stories	by	the	way…

In	the	last	section,	we	talked	about	“jump	off	points”	in	conversation	and	how
that’s	 how	 we	 learn	 to	 relate	 to	 one	 another.	 The	 examples	 showed	 jump	 off
points	in	individual	sentences.

In	 real	 life,	 people	 speak	 in	 more	 than	 sentences;	 they	 speak	 to	 each	 other	 in
stories.	So	you’ll	want	to	develop	the	ability	to	formulate	entire	stories	around
jump	off	points,	as	well	as	notice	jump	off	points	within	entire	stories.

This	is	actually	much	easier	than	it	sounds,	and	you	probably	do	it	naturally	with
your	friends	and	family	in	a	lot	of	situations.	The	idea	is	to	just	do	it	consistently
and	naturally	and	with	anybody,	including	attractive	women.

Relating	 and	 Connecting:	 The	 final	 goal	 of	 a	 successful	 conversation	 is	 to
actually	make	a	personal	connection	with	the	woman	you’re	talking	to.

When	 you	 are	 talking	 to	 a	 woman,	 there	 are	 only	 two	 real	 subjects	 of
conversation:	her	and	you.	Everything	you	speak	about	should	be,	in	some	way,
revealing	your	identity	to	her	or	her	identity	to	you.

This	 uncovering	 of	 identity	 is	 what	 creates	 the	 sense	 of	 a	 “connection.”	 The
greater	the	connection	you	create,	the	more	she’ll	want	to	spend	time	with	you
and	vice-versa.

Making	 a	 connection	 requires	 three	 steps:	 1)	 being	 open	 about	 yourself,	 2)
getting	her	to	be	open	about	herself,	and	3)	relating	to	each	other’s	experiences.

So	what	do	you	talk	about?	How	do	you	talk	about	yourself	openly?	When	I	tell
guys	 “talk	 about	 yourself	 more.	 Open	 up.”	 A	 lot	 of	 them	 go	 out	 and	 say,	 “I’m
from	 New	 York.	 I	 like	 baseball.	 I’m	 27.”	 It’s	 good	 that	 they’re	 sharing
themselves	now,	but	that’s	a	bit	shallow.

Take	out	a	sheet	of	paper	and	write	down	three	things	for	each	of	the	following:

-	Your	passions	and	favorite	things	to	do.
-	Your	dreams,	ambitions,	life	goals.
-	The	best/worst	things	that	have	happened	to	you.
-	Your	childhood,	family	life,	and	upbringing.

Now,	go	back	to	each	item	you	wrote	down	and	talk	about	it	to	yourself	for	one
minute.	Try	to	be	as	detailed	and	honest	as	possible.
It’s	 not	 as	 easy	 as	 it	 sounds.	 Even	 when	 you’re	 alone	 sometimes	 talking	 about
these	subjects	makes	you	a	little	uneasy.

Most	 men	 feel	 a	 bit	 vulnerable	 when	 talking	 about	 these	 topics,	 especially	 to
women.	That’s	the	point.

Be	willing	to	share	any	part	of	yourself	to	anyone	at	any	time	and	on	any	level.
You	have	nothing	to	lose	by	sharing	yourself.	At	the	worst,	she’ll	reject	you	and,
well,	 she’s	 going	 to	 reject	 you	 if	 all	 you	 do	 is	 talk	 about	 sports	 and	 your	 job
anyway,	so	what’s	the	problem?

What	 you’ll	 actually	 find	 is	 when	 you	 share	 something	 deeper	 and	 personal
about	 yourself,	 it	 will	 be	 genuine	 and	 she’ll	 immediately	 respond	 to	 that	 by
being	genuine	herself.

Ideally,	 sharing	 these	 aspects	 of	 yourself	 will	 encourage	 her	 to	 share	 them	 in
herself.	You	want	to	get	 her	to	 talk	about	her	passions,	her	ambitions,	her	best
experiences	 and	 her	 most	 vulnerable	 experiences.	 These	 are	 the	 topics	 that
define	 us	 as	 humans	 and	 make	 us	 unique	 —	 that	 is,	 different	 from	 the	 last	 20
guys	who	talked	to	her.

These	are	the	topics	of	conversation	that	will	make	you	stand	out.	Why?	Because
she	 knows	 you.	 Not	 your	 favorite	 sports	 team.	 Not	 the	 party	 you	 went	 to	 last
week,	but	you.

And	when	she	knows	you	and	remembers	you,	she’ll	make	sure	to	pick	up	the
phone	when	you	call	and	meet	up	with	you	again.

In	conclusion:	 When	 it	 comes	 to	 conversations,	 there’s	 a	 lot	 to	 cover.	 Reading
this	 last	 section	 may	 have	 been	 overwhelming	 for	 you.	 If	 so,	 just	 remember:
break	it	up	into	little	chunks,	practice	one	thing	at	a	time.

But	now	that	we’ve	covered	how	to	hold	a	dynamic	and	interesting	conversation,
let’s	talk	about	how	to	spice	it	up.	Let’s	talk	about	humor.

Humor

There’s	an	old	saying,	if	you	can	make	a	woman	laugh	then	you	can	get	her	to
laugh	right	into	bed.	Now,	although	humor	is	not	a	cure-all	for	anybody’s	dating
problems,	it’s	definitely	important.	In	fact,	in	many	surveys	of	what	women	look
for	most	in	a	man,	“sense	of	humor”	is	almost	always	at	the	top	of	that	list.

The	reason	is	that	a	strong	sense	of	humor	conveys	all	of	the	attractive	traits	of
your	 identity	 to	 a	 woman.	 A	 man	 who	 can	 laugh	 easily	 at	 the	 world	 and	 who
isn’t	afraid	to	laugh	at	himself	conveys	a	sense	of	non-neediness.	He	also	makes
women	 feel	 good	 around	 him	 and,	 therefore,	 more	 secure.	 A	 man	 who	 is	 very
serious	 and	 unable	 to	 laugh	 at	 himself	 or	 the	 world	 conveys	 that	 he	 is	 heavily
invested	in	the	perceptions	of	the	world	around	him	and	is	therefore	needy.

Your	specific	type	of	sense	of	humor	isn’t	so	important	as	much	as	that	you	have
it.	Obviously,	different	women	will	respond	strongly	to	different	types	of	humor,
but	 this	 is	 less	 a	 function	 of	 your	 ability	 to	 tell	 jokes	 and	 more	 a	 function	 of
demographics.	 Sarcastic	 women	 will	 like	 sarcastic	 men.	 Silly	 women	 will	 like
silly	men,	and	so	on.	Focus	on	what	you	find	funny	to	you	personally,	and	don’t
be	 afraid	 to	 share	 that	 with	 the	 women	 you	 meet.	 If	 they	 laugh,	 then	 great!	 If
they	don’t,	then	chances	are	it	wasn’t	going	to	work	anyway.

At	 its	 core,	 humor	 is	 the	 art	 of	 drawing	 connections	 between	 two	 seemingly
unrelated	ideas	or	objects.	There	are	a	number	of	ways	to	do	this,	but	at	its	core,
humor	is	a	creative	activity	and,	therefore,	will	greatly	be	tied	to	your	ability	to
uninhibitedly	express	yourself.

Sometimes	your	jokes	will	fall	flat,	particularly	when	you’re	starting	out.	That’s
OK.	 Don’t	 laugh	 at	 yourself.	 Don’t	 make	 fun	 of	 yourself.	 Don’t	 try	 to	 explain
the	joke.	These	are	all	needy	responses	that	are	dependent	on	others’	perceptions
of	 yourself	 rather	 than	 your	 own.	 Sometimes	 jokes	 are	 bad	 or	 unfunny.	 That’s
fine.	Just	move	on.

In	this	section,	I’ll	give	a	brief	overview	of	a	few	types	of	humor:	misdirection,
exaggeration,	sarcasm,	wordplay,	and	roleplaying.

Misdirection:	 One	 of	 the	 most	 common	 and	 easiest	 forms	 of	 humor	 is
misdirection.	 Misdirection	 occurs	 when	 you	 begin	 to	 say	 something	 or	 tell	 a
story	that	leads	the	listener	to	believe	you’re	making	one	point,	and	then	out	of
nowhere	you	say	something	completely	different.	For	instance,	here’s	a	famous
line	by	Steve	Martin:

“You	 know	 that	 look	 women	 get	 when	 they	 want	 to	 have	 sex?	 ...	 Yeah,	 me
neither.”

The	line	sets	you	up	to	believe	that	he’s	going	to	tell	you	a	story	about	the	time	a
woman	gave	him	a	look	like	she	wanted	to	have	sex	with	him.	But	he	misdirects
you	 and	 ends	 up	 making	 a	 joke	 about	 his	 own	 sexual	 inexperience.	 Here’s
another	one	from	Jimmy	Fallon:

“There’s	a	new	book	out	called	‘Why	Women	Have	Sex’	that	says	there	are	237
reasons	why	women	have	sex.	And	folks,	David	Letterman	knows	the	top	10.”

Again,	he	sets	up	the	joke	by	telling	you	about	a	new	book	out	relating	to	why
women	 have	 sex.	 But	 he	 then	 takes	 the	 idea	 of	 there	 being	 237	 reasons	 why
women	have	sex	and	relates	it	to	David	Letterman’s	famous	“Top	10”	segments
on	his	show	and	the	fact	that	Letterman	got	caught	sleeping	with	his	interns.	It’s
the	connection	of	these	two	seemingly	unrelated	topics	that	makes	it	funny.

Exaggeration:	 Exaggeration	 is	 another	 mainstay	 of	 humor	 and	 something	 that
everyone	should	be	able	to	use.	Exaggeration	is	when	you	take	a	quality	about
something,	 and	 blow	 it	 completely	 out	 of	 proportion,	 often	 in	 a	 creative	 or
interesting	way.	For	instance:

“She’s	a	nice	woman,	though.	Nicest	three	acres	of	flesh	I’ve	ever	met.”

Obviously,	 no	 woman	 actually	 has	 three	 acres	 worth	 of	 flesh.	 But	 the
exaggeration	of	her	being	fat	is	what	causes	this	line	to	be	funny.	There’s	also	a
subtle	misdirection	in	the	line	(going	from	“she’s	nice”	to	“she’s	fat”).

Typically,	 the	 more	 creative	 and	 extreme	 you	 are	 in	 describing	 your
exaggeration,	 the	 funnier	 it	 will	 be.	 For	 instance,	 notice	 the	 difference	 in	 how
funny	the	following	two	lines	are:

“She	was	as	ugly	as	a	dog.”

“I’ve	seen	more	attractive	things	in	the	bottom	of	an	airport	urinal.”

Notice	 the	 second	 one	 is	 far	 more	 extreme	 and	 creative.	 The	 completely
unrelated	 ideas	 of	 an	 airport	 urinal	 and	 a	 girl’s	 face	 (I’m	 laughing	 just	 typing
this)	is	what	creates	the	greater	degree	of	humor.

In	humor,	the	more	specific	and	odd	the	details,	typically	the	more	funny	a	joke
is.

Teasing	and	Sarcasm:	Whereas	misdirection	and	exaggeration	are	funny	to	just
about	 anybody,	 you’ll	 run	 into	 a	 minority	 of	 women	 who	 don’t	 find	 teasing	 or
sarcasm	funny.	Teasing	and	sarcasm	can	also	vary	in	degrees	of	appropriateness,
especially	depending	on	where	you	are.	If	you’re	at	a	funeral,	it’s	probably	not	a
good	idea	to	make	sarcastic	comments	about	the	deceased’s	family.

Teasing	 is	 when	 you	 make	 humorous	 comments	 that	 are	 derogatory	 about
someone.	 Generally,	 teasing	 is	 done	 in	 good	 humor	 and	 with	 good	 intentions.
Teasing	 with	 bad	 intentions	 becomes	 insulting	 and	 is	 not	 welcome	 by	 most
people.

Teasing	is	supposed	to	be	fun.	The	ideal	tease	will	create	a	mixture	of	emotions
in	a	girl:	defensiveness	yet	happiness.	The	ideal	reaction	is	when	a	girl	will	say,
“Oh	my	god,	I	can’t	believe	you	said	that,”	but	will	be	laughing	at	the	same	time
and	smiling.	Here	are	a	couple	examples	of	teases:

(To	a	woman	wearing	bright	red	shoes)

“Are	you	going	to	click	your	heels	to	go	home	later?”

(To	a	woman	sitting	by	herself	in	the	corner	looking	bored)

“So	who	put	you	in	timeout?”

(To	a	woman	waving	a	dollar	bill	at	the	bartender	to	get	his	attention)

“Is	that	how	you	always	get	men	to	pay	attention	to	you?”

Be	careful	with	teases,	especially	to	women	you	don’t	know.	I	said	the	last	one
to	a	woman	I	didn’t	know	and	got	slapped.	Then	again,	I	still	slept	with	her,	but
when	you	tease	frequently	and	freely,	be	prepared	for	a	wide	range	of	emotional

responses.	 Teasing	 polarizes,	 often	 hard	 and	 quickly.	 Therefore,	 it’s	 a	 good
tactic,	but	not	always	exactly	pleasant.

Sometimes	girls	will	genuinely	be	offended	or	sensitive	to	teasing	and	not	react
well.	I’d	say	maybe	1/3	of	the	women	I	meet	do	not	react	 well	 to	teasing	 or	 a
good-natured	ribbing.	Make	a	point	to	spot	these	women	and	let	the	teasing	go.
Generally	 women	 who	 don’t	 enjoy	 being	 teased	 really	 appreciate	 genuine
compliments,	so	I	switch	it	up.

Sarcasm	is	an	even	darker	form	of	humor	than	teasing.	Sarcasm	works	on	even
fewer	women,	but	the	women	who	appreciate	it	really	appreciate	it.	Chances	are
a	lot	of	you	reading	this	don’t	have	a	very	sarcastic	sense	of	humor.	That’s	fine.
You	can	just	live	a	sexless	and	lonely	life	forever.

(That	was	sarcasm	if	you	missed	it.)

Seriously,	 sarcasm	 isn’t	 for	 everybody.	 Sarcasm	 is	 when	 you	 make	 an	 extreme
statement	that’s	completely	opposite	of	what	you	actually	mean.	You	often	say	it
with	complete	seriousness	and	without	smiling.

A	lot	of	women	won’t	get	sarcastic	humor.	They’ll	think	you’re	being	serious	or
they’ll	 get	 confused.	 Others	 don’t	 enjoy	 it	 very	 much.	 But	 I	 will	 say,	 in	 my
experience,	when	a	woman	loves	sarcasm,	she	loves	sarcasm.

Years	ago,	I	was	out	with	a	girl	at	a	bar.	We	had	been	flirting	all	night	and	she
had	 a	 very	 sarcastic	 sense	 of	 humor.	 At	 one	 point	 she	 looked	 at	 my	 drink	 and
said,	“You	drink	slow,	I’ve	already	finished	my	drink!"

I	replied	with	a	totally	straight	face,	“Not	all	of	us	hate	ourselves	as	much	as	you
do.”

She	 nearly	 fell	 over	 laughing.	 She	 loved	 it	 and	 we	 ended	 up	 having	 a	 great
relationship	together.

The	 Role	 of	 Swearing:	 Swearing	 and	 dirty	 language	 has	 an	 interesting	 role	 in
humor.	Many	types	of	humor,	such	as	sarcasm	and	exaggeration	require	a	certain
level	of	edginess	to	pack	a	powerful	punch.

Using	dirty	language	or	swear	words	is	kind	of	a	cheap	and	easy	way	to	make

whatever	 you	 say	 more	 extreme.	 For	 instance,	 adding	 the	 word	 “fucking”	 into
just	about	any	humorous	statement	will	make	it	pack	a	little	more	of	a	punch.

At	the	same	time,	using	swear	words	is	kind	of	a	shortcut,	and	if	you	use	them
too	often,	they’ll	get	old	quickly	and	sound	try-hard.	Dropping	a	well-timed	F-
bomb	 can	 make	 a	 funny	 joke	 even	 funnier.	 But	 dropping	 an	 F-bomb	 into
everything	you	say	just	makes	you	look	unsophisticated.

Generally,	the	older	you	are,	the	more	I	recommend	avoiding	dirty	language.	Use
it	 sparingly	and	only	 use	 it	 when	you	 have	a	 specific	reason	to.	The	more	 you
use	 it,	 the	 more	 attention-seeking	 and	 negative	 you	 will	 make	 yourself	 appear,
both	of	which	are	unattractive	traits.

Wordplay	 and	 Puns:	 Wordplay	 is	 similar	 to	 misdirection	 in	 that	 the	 listener
expects	 one	 type	 of	 meaning	 and	 gets	 another,	 but	 wordplay	 practices
misdirection	by	using	words	that	have	various	meanings.

A	few	examples:

“Hurry,	a	passenger	is	ill.	We	need	to	get	to	a	hospital.”
“What	is	it?”

“It’s	a	building	with	lots	of	doctors.	But	we	don’t	have	time	for	that.”

Or:

“Surely,	you	can’t	be	serious!”

“I	am	serious.	And	please,	don’t	call	me	Shirley.”

I	would	say	that	puns	and	wordplay	are	an	even	rarer	form	of	appreciated	humor
than	 sarcasm.	 Puns	 and	 wordplay	 also	 tend	 to	 be	 very	 intellectual.	 You’ll	 find
few	 women	 who	 appreciate	 them.	 And	 chances	 are	 even	 fewer	 of	 you	 reading
this	 like	 to	 say	 them.	 But	 again,	 when	 you	 do	 find	 a	 woman	 who	 appreciates
them,	in	my	experience	she	really	appreciates	them.

Roleplaying	 and	 Games:	 Games	 and	 roleplaying	 are	 quick	 and	 easy	 ways	 to
inject	fun	into	any	interaction	with	a	woman.	They’re	playful.	And	they	open	up
plenty	of	opportunities	for	other	types	of	humor	when	you	use	them.

Games	can	be	anything	from	basic	physical	games	(hand	slaps,	thumb	wars,	etc.)
to	 word	 games	 (five	 questions	 game,	 fuck/marry/kill,	 etc.).	 For	 instance,
fuck/marry/kill	 is	 easy.	You	 point	 to	 three	random	 people	 in	the	 room	and	 you
say,	“OK,	out	of	those	three	people,	who	would	you	fuck,	who	would	marry,	and
who	would	you	kill,	and	why?”

This	 game	 can	 lead	 to	 quite	 of	 bit	 of	 interesting	 conversation	 based	 on	 people
watching.

Roleplaying	 can	 be	 just	 as	 energizing	 and	 fun.	 Roleplaying	 basically	 involves
giving	the	woman	you’re	talking	to	a	fake	role	and	then	playing	around	with	that
role.	Some	of	my	favorite	roleplaying	involves	marriage/divorce	roleplaying.

For	 instance,	 when	 I	 first	 meet	 a	 girl,	 let’s	 say	 within	 30	 seconds	 she	 says
something	 I	 don’t	 like.	 I’ll	 say,	 “That’s	 it,	 we’re	 getting	 divorced.”	 It’s	 funny
because	I	just	met	her,	but	you	can	actually	milk	a	lot	of	fun	out	of	something
simple	like	this	—	for	example,	“You	keep	the	kids,	I’m	moving	to	Europe.”	“By
the	way,	your	music	sucks,	and	I	never	liked	your	casseroles	either.”

If	you	find	yourself	having	a	lot	of	trouble	with	humor,	I	recommend	watching	a
lot	of	stand-up	comedians.	Some	of	my	favorites	are	Louis	CK,	George	Carlin,
and	 Bill	 Hicks.	 Pay	 attention	 to	 their	 delivery,	 their	 timing,	 and	 their	 facial
expressions.	 These	 things	 can’t	 be	 taught	 in	 a	 book,	 so	 pay	 attention	 to	 them.
Pick	 a	 few	 of	 your	 favorite	 comics	 and	 watch	 their	 stand-up	 routines	 multiple
times	to	get	a	real	sense	of	how	they	tell	a	story	and	how	they	nail	a	punchline.

Also,	 beware	 of	 falling	 into	 the	 trap	 of	 self-deprecating	 humor.	 A	 lot	 of	 men,
particularly	 needy	 men	 who	 are	 highly	 invested	 in	 other	 people’s	 reactions
around	them,	will	make	fun	of	themselves	and	put	themselves	down	in	order	to
get	a	laugh.

Although	 this	 may	 make	 women	 laugh,	 when	 used	 in	 excess,	 it’s	 a	 needy
behavior	 because	 you’re	 sacrificing	 your	 own	 self-perception	 for	 the	 sake	 of
others’	 amusement.	 Therefore,	 it’s	 ultimately	 unattractive.	 Guys	 with	 a	 good
sense	of	humor	who	habitually	use	it	on	themselves,	I	recommend	turning	those
same	 jokes	 and	 thoughts	 onto	 the	 women	 you’re	 talking	 to.	 Instead	 of	 making
fun	of	yourself,	make	fun	of	her.	It	may	feel	uncomfortable	at	first,	but	you’ll	be
surprised	 at	 how	 it	 will	 blow	 your	 interactions	 wide	 open	 and	 infuse	 more
sexuality	and	playfulness	into	them.

Humor	is	not	a	cure-all	for	your	problems	with	attracting	and	seducing	women
(if	there	were	a	cure-all,	it’d	be	physicality;	Chapter	14).	Some	naturally	funny
men	 overly	 rely	 on	 their	 ability	 to	 make	 a	 girl	 laugh	 and	 actually	 overdo	 it.
Instead	of	being	attractive	and	strong	men,	they	become	entertainers	constantly
seeking	 attention	 and	 validation.	 The	 worst	 part	 about	 this	 habit	 is	 that	 it	 all
happens	 while	 making	 the	 woman	 laugh	 and	 making	 her	 enjoy	 your	 company.
So	a	lot	of	men	get	confused	and	actually	think	that	they’re	seducing	her.	She’s
smiling.	 She’s	 laughing.	 She	 likes	 me.	 She	 must	 be	 sexually	 attracted	 to	 me,
right?

Sadly,	 no.	 Humor	 is	 only	 useful	 if	 used	 in	 conjunction	 with	 leading	 her	 in	 a
dominant	manner	and	pushing	things	physically	with	her.	Ultimately,	you	aren’t
ever	really	attracting	a	woman	unless	you’re	connecting	with	her	physically	and
emotionally.	 And	 although	 humor	 is	 a	 very	 useful	 tool	 to	 help	 you	 do	 that,	 it
doesn’t	actually	do	it	for	you.

Chapter	13:
The	Dating	Process

Like	it	or	not,	the	dating	process	follows	a	somewhat	rigid	line.	Boy	meets	girl,
asks	girl	on	date,	corresponds	with	girl,	sets	up	date	with	girl,	corresponds	with
girl,	 sets	 up	 second	 date	 with	 girl,	 repeat	 until	 eventually	 you	 bring	 girl	 home
with	 you,	 and	 at	 some	 point	 you	 decide	 if	 you’re	 exclusive,	 non-exclusive,	 a
casual	 couple,	 fuck	 buddies,	 soul-mates,	 or	 never	 want	 to	 see	 each	 other	 ever
again.

There	are	exceptions	to	this	process,	and	the	process	can	be	sped	up	to	a	degree,
but	more	or	less,	there’s	a	courtship	process	that	we	all	follow.	Our	culture	has
silently	 defined	 a	 procedure	 for	 these	 things,	 and	 any	 man	 who	 wishes	 to	 be
successful	with	women	needs	to	be	aware	of	the	procedure.

The	 process	 almost	 always	 involves	 the	 following:	 trading	 of	 contact	 details,
talking	 through	 text	 or	 phone	 conversations,	 going	 on	 dates,	 sex,	 and	 figuring
out	what	kind	of	relationship	(if	any)	will	result.	Usually	(but	not	always)	in	that
order.	In	certain	instances,	the	contact	details	and	date	can	be	forgone	and	you
can	bring	her	home	(or	go	home	with	her)	the	day/night	you	meet	her.	But	these
cases	 are	 rare	 and	 usually	 involve	 meeting	 a	 woman	 in	 a	 party	 or	 nightclub
situation	which	we	won’t	get	into	a	whole	lot	of	depth	about.

Phone	Numbers

There’s	 a	 minor	 obsession	 in	 men’s	 dating	 advice	 about	 phone	 numbers,
correspondence,	and	so-called	“text	game”	or	“flake	prevention.”

Flaking	 is	 a	 term	 often	 used	 to	 describe	 a	 woman	 who	 gives	 you	 her	 phone
number,	 says	 she	 wants	 to	 see	 you	 again,	 and	 then	 either	 never	 responds	 or
returns	your	call,	or	never	shows	up	on	a	date.	Flakes	can	simply	be	women	who
never	respond	to	you	or	women	who	respond	but	keep	sidestepping	meeting	up
with	you.

Obsessing	about	flakes	and	how	to	win	them	over	is	an	easy	trap	to	fall	into.	But
in	my	opinion,	this	is	treating	the	symptom,	not	the	illness.

The	way	to	prevent	flakes	is	to	meet	and	attract	women	who	are	so	interested	in
you	that	they	would	never	consider	flaking.

Problem	solved.

In	 my	 experience,	 99%	 of	 the	 so-called	 flake	 prevention	 strategies	 guys
implement	—	calling	at	certain	times,	baiting	with	open-ended	texts,	pretending
to	send	a	text	to	the	“wrong	person”	—	these	will	rarely	convince	a	girl	who	was
never	attracted	to	you	to	suddenly	become	attracted	to	you.	And	even	if	by	some
chance	they	do	convince	her	to	meet	up	with	you,	you’re	now	on	a	date	with	a
woman	who	has	no	genuine	interest	being	there	with	you.

Similarly,	men	spend	way	too	much	time	obsessing	over	unimportant	details	like
how	many	times	to	text	each	day,	how	soon	to	call	her,	when	to	ask	her	out,	etc.
Setting	 rigid	 rules	 such	 as	 “wait	 three	 days	 to	 ask	 her	 out”	 or	 “never	 text	 her
twice	 in	 a	 row,”	 greatly	 limits	 you	 and	 will	 hinder	 the	 unique	 connection	 you
spent	 your	 time	 developing	 with	 the	 woman.	 And	 by	 the	 way,	 it’s	 that
connection	that’s	going	to	get	her	out	to	see	you	again,	not	the	clever	text	you
spent	45	minutes	coming	up	with.

But	 with	 that	 said,	 here	 is	 my	 version	 of	 “The	 Rules”	 to	 calling	 and	 texting
women:

-	Only	ask	a	woman	for	her	phone	number	if	she	seems	genuinely	attracted
and	 interested	 in	 you.	 Only	 ask	 for	 her	 number	 if	 you	 can	 see	 yourself
wanting	 to	 hang	 out	 with	 her	 again	 or	 having	 time	 to	 hang	 out	 with	 her
again.	If	you	meet	a	girl	who	 is	 in	 town	for	a	bachelorette	party	 for	three
days,	is	drunk,	and	you	have	a	serious	meeting	at	work	in	two	days,	don’t
bother.

-	When	you	ask	her	for	her	phone	number,	don’t	come	up	with	a	fancy	line
or	 make	 up	 a	 reason.	 Just	 ask	 her	 for	 it.	 If	 you’re	 attracted	 to	 her,	 you
shouldn’t	 be	 afraid	 to	 hide	 it	 (you’re	 a	 confident,	 dominant	 man,
remember?).	If	she’s	attracted	to	you,	she’ll	be	more	than	excited	to	give	it
to	 you.	 Most	 women	 will	 always	 give	 you	 their	 number	 when	 you	 ask.
Even	if	they	don’t	like	you	or	have	no	intention	of	ever	seeing	you	again,
they’ll	 give	 it	 to	 you.	 It’s	 simply	 far	 easier	 for	 them	 to	 ignore	 calls	 from
guys	they	don’t	like	than	to	reject	every	guy	to	their	face.

-	 Flakes	 happen	 to	 everybody.	 Get	 used	 to	 it.	 There	 are	 simply	 too	 many
things	going	on	in	most	attractive	women’s	lives	to	figure	out	why	each	one
flakes.	 It	 could	 be	 because	 her	 ex-boyfriend	 started	 calling	 her	 again.	 It
could	be	because	she	met	her	soul	mate	the	day	after	she	met	you.	It	could
be	 because	 she	 got	 in	 a	 freak	 accident	 and	 is	 in	 the	 hospital.	 It	 could	 be
because	she	got	sick	and	was	bed-ridden.	Sometimes	women	just	don’t	feel
like	dating	for	a	while.	Sometimes	they	don’t	remember	you	well	because
they	 were	 drunk	 when	 they	 met	 you.	 Sometimes	 they	 lose	 their	 phone.
Sometimes	they	 just	change	their	mind	the	next	day.	And	 sometimes	they
just	don’t	care	enough.

There	are	a	million	legitimate	reasons	women	can	flake	other	than	then	not
being	 attracted	 to	 you.	 Trying	 to	 figure	 out	 which	 ones	 are	 flaking	 for
legitimate	 reasons	 and	 which	 ones	 are	 not	 is	 more	 or	 less	 an	 impossible
task.	You’re	better	off	just	letting	it	go	and	moving	on.	In	the	end,	it	comes
down	to	the	fact	that	if	she	likes	you	enough,	she’ll	find	a	way	to	make	it
happen.	 If	 she’s	 not	 finding	 a	 way	 to	 make	 it	 happen,	 then	 she	 probably
doesn’t	like	you	as	much	as	you	thought	she	did.

Think	of	it	this	way.	If	Brad	Pitt	texted	her	asking	her	out,	do	you	think	she
could	suddenly	clear	her	busy	work	schedule	and	move	her	weekend	plans
back?	 I	 think	 so.	 If	 she’s	 not	 doing	 that	 for	 you,	 then	 she’s	 just	 not	 that
interested.

-	 My	 policy	 with	 flakes	 is	 “Three	 strikes	 you’re	 out.”	 If	 a	 woman	 flakes
once,	 I’ll	 try	 her	 a	 second	 time.	 If	 she	 doesn’t	 respond	 the	 second	 time,	 I
may	or	may	not	give	it	a	third	shot,	but	typically	if	I	do,	I	don’t	put	much
effort	into	the	third	attempt.	Often	I	will	only	try	a	woman	once	or	twice.	If
there’s	still	nothing	after	the	third	attempt,	I	move	on.

A	lot	of	women	will	give	you	excuses	why	they	can’t	meet	up,	cancel	dates,
push	 dates	 back,	 or	 simply	 stop	 responding.	 Sometimes	 they	 have
legitimate	 reasons.	Sometimes	they’re	making	excuses.	This	is	why	 at	the
first	reason	they	give,	I	always	give	them	the	benefit	of	the	doubt	and	try
again.	The	second	time,	if	I’m	particularly	interested	in	them	and/or	I	think
they	genuinely	have	had	two	legitimate	excuses,	I	will	try	them	one	more
time.	Often	I	will	even	tell	them,	“OK,	last	chance	though.”	After	the	third

try,	I	just	let	them	go.	It’s	not	worth	the	time	or	effort	at	that	point.

-	I	always	text	within	24	hours	of	getting	her	number.	I	send	a	simple	text:
“Hey	 Sara,	 it	 was	 nice	 meeting	 you.”	 That’s	 it.	 Most	 girls	 who	 are
interested	 in	 you	 will	 respond	 somewhat	 quickly.	 The	 ones	 who	 do	 not
respond	to	this	will	usually	flake	on	you.

-	From	there,	I	usually	wait	another	day	or	so	and	start	a	text	conversation.	I
like	to	reference	a	conversation	we	had	when	we	met	in	this	text	to	try	and
keep	some	continuity.	The	goal	here	is	nothing	special,	just	trying	to	get	a
little	 bit	 of	 back	 and	 forth	 going.	 It’s	 been	 over	 24	 hours	 and	 I’m	 seeing
how	warm	the	lead	still	is.	Typically,	if	I	can	get	a	text	conversation	going
here,	then	she’s	pretty	likely	to	go	on	a	date	with	me.	If	her	responses	are
few	and	far	between,	then	she’s	likely	a	flake.

Don’t	get	fancy	and	try	to	re-invent	the	wheel	here.	Don’t	get	cute	or	try	to
win	her	over	if	she’s	not	responding	very	much.	Your	legwork	was	put	in
when	you	met	her,	now	you’re	stuck	with	what	you	earned.	I’ve	found	that
the	cuter	or	harder	you	try	to	win	girls	over	by	text,	the	bigger	chance	you
have	of	looking	needy	and	desperate	and	losing	them.

Joke	and	tease	her	if	she’s	being	responsive.	If	she’s	not,	stick	to	trying	to
get	her	out	ASAP.

-	 Depending	 how	 the	 text	 conversation	 goes,	 I’ll	 either	 ask	 her	 out	 right
then	and	there,	or	I’ll	wait	another	day	or	two	depending	on	my	schedule.	It
used	to	be	expected	that	you	call	women,	but	texting	has	quickly	overtaken
phone	calls.	Back	in	2005	when	I	started	this	stuff,	I	called	every	number	I
got.	 Now	 I	 almost	 never	 call	 a	 girl	 unless	 she	 specifically	 asks	 that	 I	 call
her.	 I	 would	 say	 in	 the	 last	 year,	 over	 90%	 of	 my	 dates	 have	 been	 set	 up
through	texting.

-	I	have	to	say	this	again:	don’t	get	fancy	or	cute	in	your	texts.	Texting	is,	in
general,	 an	 awful	 medium	 for	 communication.	 Often	 if	 you	 try	 to	 get	 too
sarcastic	 or	 witty	 in	 your	 texts,	 they	 can	 be	 easily	 misinterpreted	 or	 come
off	 with	 a	 completely	 different	 intention	 than	 you	 originally	 had.	 And
remember,	everything	comes	back	to	intention.	So	clear,	blunt	language.	I

tell	guys	that	I	only	use	texting	to	organize	when	she	and	I	are	going	to	see
each	 other	 next.	 Literally,	 that’s	 what	 90%	 of	 my	 texts	 consist	 of,	 things
like,	 “Hey,	 what	 are	 you	 doing	 Thursday	 night?”	 or	 “I’m	 busy	 this
weekend,	but	I	want	to	see	you	again.”

My	text	conversations	are	boring.	Just	to	give	you	an	example	of	a	typical	text
conversation,	I’ve	posted	a	transcript	below	of	the	texting	I	did	with	the	last	girl
I	went	out	on	a	date	with.

Some	background	first:	this	was	a	girl	I	met	in	a	nightclub	at	about	1	AM	and
spent	no	more	than	60-90	minutes	with.	There	was	light	kissing,	but	mostly	just
talking	and	dancing.	No	drinking	(this	is	a	biggie	actually).	And	before	she	went
home	I	mentioned	that	I’d	like	to	see	her	the	next	day.	She	said	sure.

Me:	Hey	Mary,	it	was	nice	meeting	you	tonight.
Her:	You	too!	:)
Me	(next	day):	Hey,	you	said	you	work	until	4	PM,	right?
Her:	Yes,	do	you	still	want	to	meet?
Me:	Yeah.	How	about	7:30?
Her:	Can	we	do	8?
Me:	Sure.	In	the	city	center?
Her:	Yes,	in	front	of	the	X	restaurant.	Do	you	know	where	it	is?
Me:	Yea,	see	you	there.
Her:	See	you	soon.	:)

That’s	it.	I’d	say	75%	of	my	text	correspondence	looks	like	that.

But	just	to	show	you	the	other	extreme,	here’s	a	more	unusual	text	transcript	I
had	with	a	girl	in	England	a	few	months	ago.	This	is	about	as	“gamey”	as	I	ever
get.

Me:	Hey	Natalie,	it	was	nice	meeting	you	tonight.
Her:	Hey,	I	have	your	phone	number	now.	;)
Me:	Good,	talk	to	you	soon.
Me	(next	day):	Hey	Natalie,	how	was	the	rest	of	your	night?
Her:	Great.	We	were	tired	and	went	back	a	bit	early	though.
Me:	Good.	Are	you	free	tomorrow	evening?	Let’s	meet	up	for	a	drink.
Her:	OK.	When	did	you	have	in	mind?

Me:	How	about	8	at	X,	do	you	know	it?
Her:	Yes	I	do.	8	it	is.	I’ll	text	you	tomorrow.	Good	night.
Me:	Good	night.
Her	(next	day):	Hey,	I’m	overloaded	at	work	and	may	not	be	able	to	meet
you	tonight.	Sorry.	I	hope	you	enjoy	England.
Me:	Come	on	Natalie.	When	you’re	old	and	grey	are	you	going	to	wish	you
worked	more	or	wish	you	went	on	more	dates	with	cute	American	boys?
Her:	Haha!	Very	true.	Let	me	see	what	I	can	do.
Her	(later):	OK,	I	finished	early.	I	can	meet	you.	:)

Notice	 how	 the	 only	 bit	 of	 “game”	 I	 threw	 at	 her	 was	 when	 she	 showed
hesitance	to	meet	up.	The	only	reason	I	did	this	is	because	I	knew	I	was	going	to
lose	 her	 if	 I	 didn’t	 amp	 things	 up,	 show	 my	 desire	 for	 her	 again	 and	 polarize
things	a	bit	to	prevent	the	flake.	I	did	that.	And	it	worked.

Or	did	it?

Natalie	never	showed	up.	She	called	me	at	about	7:40	PM	and	explained	to	me
that	although	she	liked	me	a	lot	that	because	I	was	leaving	England	in	a	few	days
she	couldn’t	justify	coming	on	a	date	with	me.	It	was	clear	she	felt	bad	about	it,
but	her	values	were	clear.

I	 respected	 that	 decision	 and	 told	 her	 that	 it	 was	 fine,	 that	 she	 was	 a	 beautiful
girl,	and	that	she	deserves	a	great	guy	who	will	stick	around.	And	I	meant	it.

And	unfortunately,	this	has	consistently	been	my	experience.	A	flake	is	a	flake.
No	 matter	 what	 you	 do.	 Even	 if	 you	 can	 create	 a	 temporary	 illusion	 that	 she
wants	to	meet	up	with	you.

If	 anything,	 being	 cute	 and	 trying	 to	 impress	 her	 will	 only	 hurt	 you,	 as	 it	 will
come	across	as	needy	and	unattractive.	One	of	the	quickest	ways	to	lose	a	girl	is
by	texting	her	stuff	that’s	way	too	try-hard.

When	in	doubt,	be	plain	and	to-the-point.

This	often	disappoints	some	guys.	They	get	really	excited	about	sending	fancy	or
brilliant	texts	that	magically	change	a	girl’s	mind	on	a	dime.	Don’t	bother.	Short
of	lying	or	manipulation,	it	almost	never	works.

You’re	not	going	to	be	texting	Shakespearean	Sonnets	to	her.	Get	her	to	agree	to

meet	up	as	soon	as	possible	and	then	do	all	of	the	heavy	lifting	in	person,	where
you	 can	 interact	 physically,	 where	 she	 can	 see	 your	 intentions	 and	 your	 non-
neediness,	and	where	you’re	not	limited	to	120	characters	at	a	time	or	whatever.

The	Perfect	Date

Despite	 how	 nervous	 you	 get	 beforehand,	 dates	 are	 perhaps	 the	 most
straightforward	part	of	this	entire	process.	Go	to	the	right	venues,	go	at	the	right
times,	avoid	the	obvious	pitfalls,	and	you	should	be	in	the	clear.

When	to	Go	on	Dates:	Don’t	do	lunch	dates,	and	never	make	an	afternoon	date
the	 first	 date	 if	 possible.	 Just	 don’t	 do	 it.	 For	 whatever	 reason,	 nothing	 says,
“let’s	just	be	friends”	more	than	having	lunch	together.

Save	 dates	 for	 the	 nighttime.	 It	 builds	 a	 greater	 sense	 of	 expectation.	 There’s
more	 flexibility	 to	 spend	 more	 time	 together.	 It’s	 more	 of	 a	 commitment.	 And
neither	of	you	are	in	a	rush	to	be	anywhere	in	an	hour.	It	also	leaves	the	option
open	for	you	or	her	sleeping	over.

As	far	as	when	to	go,	it’s	going	to	depend	a	lot	on	what	you’re	doing.	But	you
want	 to	 allow	 yourself	 time	 for	 at	 least	 three	 one-hour	 activities	 (more	 on	 that
later).	So	anywhere	between	6	PM	to	9	PM.	Later	than	that,	and	you	limit	your
time	 together.	 Earlier	 than	 that,	 and	 you	 get	 a	 daytime	 vibe	 and	 the	 date	 will
usually	run	out	of	steam	before	she	has	to	go	home.	You	want	to	time	the	date	so
that	you	are	peaking	together	at	around	10	PM	or	11	PM	and	she	has	the,	“I	need
to	go	home,	but	I	don’t	want	to	yet,”	feeling.

Where	to	Go:	Absolutely	no	movie	dates	for	first	or	second	dates.	Movie	dates
are	terrible.	You	don’t	get	to	talk,	you	sit	awkwardly	next	to	each	other,	and	it’s
impossible	to	touch	her	without	being	awkward	(importance	of	this	in	the	next
chapter).

Avoid	 dinner	 dates	 if	 at	 all	 possible.	 They’re	 cliché.	 They	 can	 be	 somewhat
impersonal	 depending	 on	 where	 you	 eat.	 Once	 again,	 it’s	 almost	 impossible	 to
touch.	And	believe	it	or	not,	a	lot	of	women	are	self-conscious	about	eating	in
front	of	you,	food	selection,	etc.	Also,	you	can	avoid	the	awkward	“who	pays?”
situation	—	which	we’ll	talk	about	in	the	next	section.

Good	 date	 locations	 are	 locations	 that	 are	 active,	 participatory,	 and	 allow	 for

touching	and	flirting.	Alcohol	can	be	helpful	as	well	if	that’s	your	style.	 Some
good	examples	include	comedy	clubs,	dance	classes,	museum	exhibits,	walks	in
interesting	 places	 (plazas,	 parks,	 etc.),	 concerts,	 or	 just	 grabbing	 a	 drink
somewhere.

A	lot	of	places	to	go	will	depend	on	your	town.	I	recommend	using	Yelp.com	to
find	 interesting	 places	 around	 you.	 For	 instance,	 there	 used	 to	 be	 a	 bowling
alley/nightclub	venue	near	my	old	apartment	in	Boston.	It	was	a	lot	of	fun.	You
could	bowl	together	(participatory,	active,	allows	flirting)	as	well	as	have	a	few
drinks,	 and	 if	 things	 went	 well	 and	 we	 were	 in	 a	 party	 mood,	 we	 could	 go
downstairs	and	dance.

Bars	and	nightclubs	are	fine	if	you	both	are	into	those	kinds	of	venues.	Just	make
sure	that	if	you	go,	you	end	up	there	alone.	A	date	with	friends	is	not	a	date.	This
will	 often	 happen	 if	 she	 suggests	 a	 bar	 to	 go	 —	 “Oh,	 we	 can	 meet	 my	 friend
Cindy	there…”	Chances	are	if	she	wants	to	hang	out	with	her	friend	with	you,
then	it’s	no	longer	a	date.

Finally,	you	should	find	venues	and	activities	that	are	close	to	either	your	place
or	 her	 place.	 What	 I	 recommend	 doing	 is	 researching	 and	 finding	 at	 least	 4-6
good	 date	 venues	 or	 activities	 that	 are	 within	 a	 short	 drive	 of	 your	 house	 or
apartment.	 Even	 better	 is	 if	 you	 can	 find	 a	 few	 places	 that	 are	 within	 walking
distance.

The	logic	is	simple:	the	closer	the	venues	are	to	your	place	or	hers,	the	less	travel
time	necessary,	the	fewer	logistical	headaches,	and	the	better	the	chance	of	you
ending	up	at	each	other’s	houses	at	the	end	of	the	night.

Once	you’ve	researched	and	found	4-6	venues	and	activities	near	your	place	that
you	enjoy	doing,	that	are	good	date	activities	and	are	easily	accessible,	it’s	time
to	start	putting	them	together	and	do	multiple	things	on	each	date.

This	may	sound	weird	to	you,	but	this	is	key.	Most	men	do	dinner	and	then	sit	at
the	 table	 for	 another	 hour	 chatting	 away.	 There’s	 little	 flirting.	 No	 activity.	 No
touching.	No	sense	of	dynamics	or	change.

On	our	dates,	we	are	doing	things	—	lots	of	things.	We’re	going	bowling,	having
drinks,	 dancing,	 checking	 out	 statues	 in	 the	 park	 and	 carriage	 riding	 —	 all	 in
three	hours.

There’s	something	strange	in	human	psychology.	Our	level	of	intimacy	with	one
another	 doesn’t	 just	 come	 from	 how	 much	 we	 talk	 about	 as	 much	 as	 it	 comes
from	 the	 experiences	 we	 share.	 These	 dates	 are	 designed	 to	 create	 as	 much
mutual	 experience	 as	 possible	 in	 the	 least	 amount	 of	 time	 possible.	 Here	 are
some	examples	of	solid	dates:

Meet	for	coffee	get	ice	cream	down	the	street	check	out	the	big	swing	in	the
park	shopping	together	at	quirky	bookstore

Salsa	 class	 drinks	 next	 door	 afterward	 walk	 to	 neighborhood	 pizza	 place
video	games	at	your	place

Window	 shopping	 at	 local	 shopping	 center	 improv	 comedy	 show	 quick
dinner	afterward	walk	around	local	park

Include	 dancing	 if	 at	 all	 possible,	 as	 it’s	 the	 most	 sexual	 date	 activity	 you	 can
have.	 Also,	 if	 you	 two	 decide	 to	 drink,	 try	 to	 drink	 at	 the	 second	 or	 last
venues/activities.	You	don't	ever	want	to	end	up	hammered	on	a	date.

How	 to	 Behave	 on	 a	 Date:	 As	 I	 mentioned	 before,	 you	 want	 your	 dates	 to	 be
interactive.	 You	 want	 to	 be	 able	 to	 walk	 around,	 be	 able	 to	 touch	 and	 be	 as
interactive	as	possible.

The	underlying	concept	to	have	on	a	date	is	that	you	should	try	to	constantly	be
leading.

Every	 decision	 should	 be	 yours	 and	 she	 should	 be	 expected	 to	 follow	 it.
Remove,	“What	do	you	want	to	do	now?”	from	your	dating	vocabulary.	Never
say	it	again.

It	 should	 be	 like	 this:	 “Hey,	 let’s	 grab	 some	 tacos,	 I	 know	 a	 cool	 stand	 over
here,”	“I	got	an	idea,	I’m	going	to	kick	your	ass	in	air	hockey,”	“Let’s	check	out
the	Science	museum,	they	have	an	awesome	exhibit	on	the	human	body,”	etc.

As	 far	 as	 what	 to	 talk	 about,	 your	 conversations	 should	 be	 getting	 deeper	 and
more	 personal.	 There	 should	 be	 less	 teasing	 and	 playful	 banter	 and	 more
conversations	 about	 your	 lives	 and	 what’s	 important	 to	 you.	 Learn	 about	 her
past,	her	passions,	her	dreams,	what	her	favorite	things	are.

At	 the	 same	 time,	 you	 don’t	 want	 to	 turn	 this	 into	 a	 job	 interview	 (which	 too

many	dinner	dates	turn	into),	but	elicit	these	topics	by	sharing	them	yourself.

Finally,	 the	 big	 question	 in	 our	 post-feminism	 world:	 who	 pays?	 These	 days,
most	women	will	offer	to	pay	out	of	politeness,	but	you’re	supposed	to	turn	them
down	 because	 it’s	 the	 gentleman	 thing	 to	 do	 (or	 something	 like	 that).	 Look,	 I
didn’t	make	this	stuff	up,	but	after	being	on	probably	100+	dates	with	dozens	of
women,	and	getting	into	more	than	a	few	awkward	situations	about	paying,	this
is	what	works	for	me:	pay	unless	she	physically	pulls	out	her	wallet/credit	card
and	stops	you.	Until	she	physically	does	that,	just	pay.

Yes,	once	in	a	while	you	can	get	women	buying	you	drinks	and	stuff	—	there	are
even	ways	to	influence	them	to	do	this	—	but	at	the	end	of	the	day,	unless	you’re
broke,	 take	 care	 of	 them.	 It’s	 a	 no-lose	 move	 and	 it	 will	 win	 you	 points	 with
many	of	them.

Chapter	14:
Physicality	and	Sex

Let’s	talk	about	sex.	And	more	specifically,	why	women	have	it,	and	why	they
would	ever	want	to	have	it	with	you.

Female	sexuality	has	been	a	murky	area	in	psychology	for	almost	a	century	now.
Freud	 famously	 said	 at	 one	 point,	 “The	 great	 question	 that	 has	 never	 been
answered,	and	which	I	have	not	yet	been	able	to	answer,	despite	my	thirty	years
of	research	into	the	feminine	soul,	is	‘what	do	women	want?’”

Among	researchers,	it	was	long	thought	that	female	arousal	was	tied	to	ideas	and
display	 of	 security,	 investment	 and	 commitment,	 particularly	 from	 high-status
men.

But	 if	 you	 think	 about	 it,	 you	 know,	 here	 in	 the	 real	 world,	 this	 doesn’t	 really
make	sense.	Because	unfortunately	for	psychologists,	women	don’t	light	candles
and	 lay	 in	 their	 bathtubs	 masturbating	 to	 a	 mortgage	 and	 a	 white	 picket	 fence.
They	fantasize	about	far	different	(and	stranger)	things.

In	 her	 book,	 My	 Secret	 Garden,	 the	 journalist	 Nancy	 Friday	 collected
anonymous	 sexual	 fantasies	 from	 women	 around	 the	 world.	 If	 you	 ever	 want
your	 mind	 expanded	 in	 an	 interesting	 way,	 check	 it	 out.	 There	 are	 women	 out
there	who	get	turned	on	by	some	really,	well,	let’s	call	it	“creative”	stuff.	We’re
talking	 about	 gangbangs,	 rape,	 weird	 locations	 and	 positions,	 anonymous	 men,
and	so	on	and	so	forth.

So	this	sort	of	data	threw	a	bit	of	a	monkey	wrench	into	everything.	For	many
years,	scientists	didn’t	really	know	where	to	start.	With	men	it	was	pretty	easy	—
we’re	 primarily	 visually	 stimulated,	 and	 we	 generally	 all	 like	 similar	 features
(symmetry,	certain	hip/waist	ratio,	large	breasts,	etc.)

But	with	women,	you	may	as	well	throw	shit	at	a	dartboard	because	that’s	about
as	far	as	things	were	getting.

One	 new	 conclusion	 in	 arousal	 research	 these	 days	 is	 that	 female	 arousal	 is
somewhat	narcissistic	in	nature.	Women	are	turned	on	by	being	wanted,	by	being
desired.

(Note:	 Men	 are	 as	 well,	 although	 since	 female	 arousal	 is	 affected	 more	 by
psychological	stimuli	than	physical	stimuli	on	average,	this	is	far	more	important
for	female	arousal.)

This	actually	explains	some	the	odd	and	disparate	things	that	seem	to	turn	some
women	 on.	 Seemingly	 disconnected	 events	 that	 arouse	 women	 —	 a	 romantic
marriage	proposal	in	one	instance,	being	tied	up	to	the	bathroom	sink	in	another
—	make	sense	when	viewed	this	way.	Both	indicate	an	extreme	desire	in	her	by
a	 man.	 A	 man	 who’s	 willing	 to	 sacrifice	 everything	 to	 be	 with	 her.	 In	 one
instance,	 the	 man	 is	 willing	 to	 commit	 his	 entire	 life	 to	 her.	 In	 another	 he’s,
willing	to	go	to	physical	extremes	for	her.	Both	are	hot.

When	women	say	that	just	because	they	have	rape	fantasies	doesn’t	mean	they
want	to	be	raped,	 this	is	what	 they	mean.	What	they	want	is	to	be	desired.	An
unhinged	desire.	A	passionate	and	uncontrollable	desire.	They	want	to	be	desired
to	the	point	that	a	man	completely	loses	awareness	and	self-control.	The	actual
rape	part	—	I’m	sure	none	of	them	would	actually	enjoy.

My	experience	supports	this	as	well.	Those	in	the	men’s	dating	advice	industry
have	 discovered	 over	 the	 past	 five	 years	 or	 so	 that	 the	 more	 assertively	 you
pursue	 a	 woman,	 the	 more	 aroused	 she	 becomes.	 There’s	 something	 almost
“magical”	about	an	uninhibited	physicality	when	being	with	a	woman.

Something	 as	 simple	 as	 taking	 a	 guy	 who	 usually	 stands	 there	 blabbering	 for
hours	about	meteorology	or	something,	if	you	take	that	same	guy	and	have	him
put	his	arm	around	the	woman	he’s	talking	to	or	have	him	lightly	touch	her	as	if
punctuating	his	points	and	jokes,	this	generates	way	more	sexual	tension.

Indeed,	 sexuality,	 in	 the	 end,	 is	 all	 about	 movement	 and	 our	 bodies	 entwining
themselves.	Everything	else	is	kind	of	just	a	means	to	reach	that	point.

I’m	 going	 to	 say	 this	 point-blank:	 getting	 physical	 with	 women,	 and	 getting
physical	quickly	and	comfortably,	is	ultimately	the	difference	between	having	a
lot	of	female	friends,	and	having	a	lot	of	girlfriends	and	dates.

Being	 physical	 with	 women	 is	 by	 far	 the	 most	 integral	 piece	 of	 seduction	 and
dating	women.	If	you	have	it,	you	will	constantly	have	options.	If	you	don’t,	you
will	spend	a	lot	of	time	alone.

I	have	a	friend.	He’s	a	decent-looking	guy.	He	almost	never	approaches	(except
when	he’s	drunk).	He’s	awkward	to	talk	to.	He	has	a	strange	sense	of	humor.	But
he	 gets	 physical	 with	 women.	 He	 touches	 them	 early.	 He	 touches	 them	 often.
And	even	if	they	don’t	reciprocate	or	move	away.	He	tries	again.	In	other	words,
he’s	always	going	for	it.

And	you	know	what?	He	gets	laid	constantly.	With	hot	women	too.

It’s	 amazing.	 I	 used	 to	 hang	 out	 with	 him	 and	 would	 watch	 him	 awkwardly
stumble	around	conversations,	drink	a	little	too	much,	and	awkwardly	putting	his
arm	 around	 girls	 as	 the	 girls	 sat	 there	 with	 a	 look	 of	 confusion.	 I’d	 watch	 him
and	think	to	myself,	“Oh	man,	what	a	disaster.”

And	then	I’d	come	back	20	minutes	later	and	he’d	be	making	out	with	her.	And
then	an	hour	later	she’d	be	excitedly	going	home	with	him.

He	just	has	no	inhibitions	whatsoever	about	going	for	it.	Unless	the	girl	would
clearly	stop	him	or	say	“No!”	he	would	always	be	going	for	it.	And	the	women
loved	it.	They	loved	his	physicality	and	his	raw	sexual	energy.	It	made	them	feel
beautiful	and	sexy	and	it	was	exciting.

(Ethical	 note	 here:	 if	 a	 woman	 clearly	 tells	 you	 to	 stop	 doing	 something,	 stop.
Don’t	take	offense,	but	instead,	ask	her	if	she’s	uncomfortable	and/or	why	she’s
uncomfortable.	 Often	 it’s	 not	 that	 she	 doesn’t	 like	 you,	 it’s	 just	 that	 you’re
moving	 too	 fast	 for	 her.	 Always	 respect	 her	 boundaries	 and	 clarify	 as	 early	 as
possible	what	she’s	comfortable	with	and	what	her	expectations	are.	Not	only	is
this	the	vulnerable	thing	to	do,	it’s	also	the	respectful	thing	to	do.)

Being	 physical	 with	 women	 is	 a	 necessary	 habit	 that	 most	 men	 who	 are	 poor
with	 women	 never	 do.	 Most	 men	 are	 a	 bit	 shy	 and	 hesitant	 when	 it	 comes	 to
“making	moves:”	touching,	the	first	kiss,	sexual	touching,	etc.	Well,	that	needs
to	 stop.	 From	 now	 on,	 you	 are	 a	 sexually	 assertive	 and	 dominant	 guy	 and	 you
have	no	shame	about	it.	We’ll	also	discover	that	women	actually	prefer	you	to	be
this	way.

There	 are	 two	 reasons	 for	 being	 physically	 assertive	 with	 women.	 The	 first	 is
polarization.	 You	 want	 to	 establish	 whether	 she’s	 sexually	 interested	 in	 you	 as
soon	as	you	possibly	can.	The	second	reason	is	that	being	physical	is	bold	and,
therefore,	a	highly	attractive	form	of	flirting.

Studies	 have	 shown	 that	 people	 being	 touched	 by	 somebody	 when	 they	 first
meet	 them	 not	 only	 have	 a	 much	 higher	 probability	 of	 thinking	 favorably	 of
them,	but	they	also	were	shown	to	trust	them	quicker.

So	how	do	you	touch	a	girl	right	off	the	bat?

As	 you	 having	 a	 conversation	 with	 her,	 assuming	 she	 is	 Receptive,	 just	 lightly
touch	her	on	the	arm,	near	the	elbow.	Don’t	press	hard	or	hold	it,	as	that	could
startle	her,	but	just	a	small	brush	or	tap	or	light	squeeze.	Use	your	touching	to
punctuate	the	conversation,	as	if	emphasizing	a	funny	moment	or	the	punchline
of	the	joke.	Think	of	touching	as	the	exclamation	marks	or	question	marks	of	the
dialogue.

For	 instance,	 let’s	 say	 you	 make	 a	 clever	 joke	 and	 she	 begins	 to	 laugh	 really
hard,	 you	 should	 put	 your	 hand	 on	 her	 arm	 to	 punctuate	 the	 emotion	 of	 the
moment.

The	 best	 way	 to	 touch	 is	 to	 integrate	 physicality	 into	 your	 conversation.	 For
example,	using	games	such	as	thumb	wars,	twirling	her	like	a	ballerina,	or	giving
high	fives	are	great	ways	to	initiate	physical	contact.	As	the	conversation	goes
on,	the	better	things	are	going,	the	more	you	want	to	be	touching	and	the	more
personal	you	want	your	touches	to	be.

Your	touching	should	happen	in	a	progression.	In	general,	you	want	to	start	on
the	outside	of	her	body	—	her	arms	and	legs	—	and	slowly	move	closer	into	her
body.	Put	your	hand	on	her	back	as	you	move	her	to	sit	down	with	you,	put	your
arm	around	her	lower	back	as	she	leans	against	the	bar	next	to	you,	etc.	Later	on,
this	progression	will	continue	into	intimacy:	tickling,	massages,	and	cuddling	(or
spooning).	 And	 from	 there	 it	 will	 continue	 on	 into	 kissing,	 petting,	 and
becoming	sexual.

Signals	Women	Give

Men	 are	 notoriously	 bad	 at	 recognizing	 “signals”	 women	 give	 them	 when
they’re	interested.	In	the	courtship	process,	it’s	always	the	man’s	responsibility
to	take	action	and	make	the	moves,	and	the	woman’s	responsibility	to	give	him
signals,	telling	him	when	to	proceed	and	when	to	stop.

Throughout	 this	 chapter,	 we	 will	 be	 discussing	 physically	 escalating	 with	 a

woman.	This	involves	touching	her	in	sexual	ways.

As	men,	we’re	kind	of	stuck	in	a	weird	place.	Because	on	the	one	hand,	we’re
always	 expected	 to	 initiate	 and	 make	 the	 first	 move.	 But	 on	 the	 other,	 we’re
supposed	to	respect	a	woman’s	desires	and	right	to	her	own	body.

This	is	why	before	proceeding	with	advice	about	getting	sexual	with	women,	I
want	 to	 take	 a	 moment	 to	 list	 out	 the	 signals	 women	 give	 that	 indicate	 she	 is
sexually	 interested	 in	 you.	 You	 should	 see	 these	 somewhat	 as	 invitations	 to
proceed	 with	 them	 physically,	 although	 due	 to	 potential	 miscommunication,
don’t	make	too	many	assumptions.	What	we’re	looking	for	is	a	consistent	stream
of	signals	coming	from	her	to	you.	Pre-approach	signals	mean	she	wants	to	talk
to	 you.	 Conversational	 signals	 mean	 she	 wants	 to	 get	 closer	 to	 you	 physically.
And	escalation	signals	mean	that	she	wants	to	get	sexual	with	you.

View	these	signals	as	green	lights	when	they	come	up,	but	only	to	move	to	the
next	 group	 of	 signals	 (i.e.,	 just	 because	 a	 woman	 makes	 eye	 contact	 with	 you
doesn’t	 mean	 she	 wants	 to	 fuck	 you	 right	 then	 and	 there,	 it	 just	 means	 she’s
curious	 about	 talking	 to	 you.)	 Take	 it	 one	 step	 at	 a	 time,	 and	 remember,	 she
always	has	the	right	to	back	out	or	change	her	mind	at	any	moment.

Pre-Approach	Signals

-	Non-Accidental	Eye	Contact:	When	in	doubt,	assume	it’s	not	accidental.
Humans	 are	 programmed	 to	 look	 at	 and	 focus	 on	 whatever	 they’re	 either
curious	about	or	what	they	find	attractive.	If	she’s	looking	at	you	even	10%
more
least	 somewhat
curious/interested	 in	 you.	 I	 make	 a	 point	 to	 approach	 every	 woman	 who
makes	non-accidental	eye	contact	with	me,	and	it	serves	me	well.

the	 average	 stranger,

then	 she’s	 at

than

-	 Smiling:	 If	 eye	 contact	 means	 she’s	 interested,	 this	 means	 “you	 better
come	talk	to	me!”

-	She	Approaches	You:	This	goes	without	saying,	although	a	lot	of	guys	are
so	oblivious,	they	even	miss	this.	If	a	woman	approaches	you,	even	if	it’s	to
ask	the	time,	about	the	weather,	for	directions,	or	whatever,	chances	are	she
has	some	interest	in	talking	to	you.

-	 Proximity:	 This	 one	 is	 subtle,	 but	 the	 more	 you	 work	 on	 your	 lifestyle,
body	language,	and	style,	the	more	of	these	you	will	get.	It’s	when	a	woman

places	 herself	 conspicuously	 near	 you	 when	 she	 doesn’t	 have	 to.	 For
instance,	let’s	say	you’re	sitting	on	a	bus	and	an	attractive	woman	gets	on.
The	entire	bus	is	empty,	yet	she	comes	over	and	sits	across	from	you.	This
could	mean	she	wants	you	to	talk	to	her.	Some	other	examples	are	when	a
woman	comes	and	stands	near	you	in	a	store	or	shop	looking	at	nothing	in
particular	for	a	long	amount	of	time.

Conversation	Signals

-	 Excessive	 Smiling/Laughing:	 This	 is	 subjective	 and	 will	 require	 some
judgment,	but	sometimes	you	will	notice	one	girl	smiling	and	laughing	a	lot
more	than	others	when	you	speak.	Chances	are	she	likes	you.

-	 Flipping	 or	 Playing	 with	 Her	 Hair:	 Classic	 signal	 of	 flirtation	 and	 often
done	unconsciously.

-	Eyes	Dilate:	Studies	have	shown	our	eyes	dilate	when	we	look	at	someone
we’re	 attracted	 to.	 Hard	 to	 notice,	 especially	 in	 some	 nighttime	 scenario.
But	 this	 gives	 her	 eyes	 a	 much	 bigger	 and	 wider	 look	 than	 normal,	 what
you	may	call	“big	doe	eyes.”

-	 Standing	 Closer	 to	 You	 Than	 Normal:	 self-explanatory.	 Pay	 attention	 to
where	she	positions	herself	while	talking	to	you.	If	it’s	slightly	within	your
bubble	of	personal	space	that	probably	indicates	she’s	interested	in	getting
physical	with	you.

-	 Excessive	 Eye	 Contact:	 Same	 as	 excessive	 smiling.	 If	 she’s	 locked	 onto
your	 gaze	 during	 a	 conversation,	 that	 means	 she’s	 very	 interested	 in	 what
you	have	to	say.	Most	people	break	eye	contact	very	often,	especially	with
people	they	just	met.	If	she	doesn’t,	that	means	she’s	interested	in	you.

-	Prioritizes	You:	Another	very	subjective	one.	This	can	be	very	subtle.	But
it’s	 when	 her	 actions	 subtly	 show	 you	 that	 she	 prioritizes	 you	 over
interacting	with	others.	The	classic	example	here	is	if	you	meet	a	girl	at	a
bar	 and	 her	 friends	 come	 over	 and	 try	 to	 talk	 to	 her	 and	 she	 ignores	 her
friends.	Most	women,	if	they	don’t	like	you,	will	drop	you	like	a	hot	potato
when	their	friends	come	around.	But	if	she	ignores	her	friends	or	stays	with
you,	that’s	a	clear	indication	that	she	likes	you.

Escalation	Signals

-	Isolates	Herself	with	You:	Oftentimes	the	most	overt	advances	a	woman
will	make	won’t	be	in	actually	making	a	move	(that’s	your	job),	but	they’ll
actively	work	to	put	you	in	the	easiest	situation	possible.	Let’s	say	I’ve	been
hanging	 out	 with	 a	 woman	 at	 a	 small	 party	 for	 most	 of	 the	 night	 and	 she
suddenly	she	says,	“let’s	take	a	walk	around	the	block,	it’s	noisy	in	here,”
she’s	 purposely	 isolating	 herself	 with	 me	 as	 much	 as	 possible.	 This
typically	means	she	wants	to	be	kissed.

-	Ditches	Her	Friends	For	You:	Goes	along	with	the	above;	it	takes	a	lot	for
a	 woman	 to	 leave	 her	 friends	 behind	 for	 a	 guy,	 especially	 one	 she’s	 only
known	 for	 a	 few	 hours	 or	 one	 night.	 If	 she	 does	 this,	 take	 it	 as	 a	 bright
green	light.

-	 Touches	 You:	 If	 she	 starts	 putting	 her	 hands	 on	 your	 arms	 or	 legs	 or	 is
demonstrating	 (or	 reciprocating)	 any	 of	 the	 touching	 I	 described	 in	 the
previous	section,	this	is	a	clear	signal:	she	is	sexually	interested	in	you	and
wants	to	be	kissed.

When	To	Go	For	the	Kiss

When	 it	 comes	 to	 kissing	 a	 woman,	 there’s	 an	 old	 adage	 amongst	 dating
coaches:	if	you	think	you	can	kiss	her,	you	probably	could	have	ten	minutes	ago.
We	men	are	horrible	at	gauging	a	woman’s	sexual	desire	and	when	she’s	ready	to
move	things	forward.

So,	in	general,	it’s	safe	to	assume	that	anytime	you	think	you	could	kiss	her,	you
probably	 already	 could	 have.	 Too	 many	 guys	 get	 hung	 up	 looking	 for	 “sign”
after	 “sign”	 when	 women	 have	 been	 giving	 them	 signals	 all	 night.	 Think	 of	 it
this	 way:	 it’s	 much	 better	 to	 try	 and	 kiss	 her	 and	 get	 rejected	 than	 to	 go	 the
whole	night	without	making	a	move	and	never	knowing	what	would	have	been.

So	the	rule	of	thumb	is,	when	in	doubt,	go	for	it.

If	you	go	in	for	the	kiss	and	she	turns	her	head	or	doesn’t	reciprocate,	pull	back
and	 ask	 her	 how	 she’s	 feeling,	 if	 she	 likes	 you	 or	 if	 you’re	 moving	 too	 fast.
Listen	to	her	response,	often	women	will	want	to	kiss	you	but	there’s	something
that’s	worrying	them	or	upsetting	them	or	making	them	self-conscious.	The	best
way	to	deal	with	this	is	through	vulnerability	and	simply	asking	her	to	be	honest
with	whatever	the	issue	is.

There	are	some	women	who	don’t	kiss	in	public	places.	They	feel	like	it’s	in	bad
taste	and	poor	form.	No	matter	how	much	they	like	you,	they	won’t	do	it.

The	same	goes	if	she’s	in	front	of	a	bunch	of	people	she	knows.	If	she’s	standing
right	next	to	four	of	her	co-workers,	she’s	probably	not	going	to	feel	comfortable
making	out	with	you.	Try	moving	her	somewhere	more	private.

Some	notes	on	kissing	well:

-	Don’t	slobber	all	over	her	face.
-	Don’t	jam	your	 tongue	down	her	throat.	Heavy	tongue	has	its	place,	but
it’s	usually	in	the	bedroom	when	you	guys	are	naked.
-	Don’t	peck	her	like	she’s	your	grandmother.
-	Don’t	 shove	 your	 face	 into	 hers	 or	 apply	 too	 much	 pressure.	 Kisses	 are
sensual.	Imagine	you’re	massaging	her	lips	with	yours.

A	 lot	 of	 kissing	 revolves	 around	 how	 you	 use	 your	 hands	 as	 well.	 Your	 hands
should	be	roaming	her	body	gently,	caressing	her	back,	gently	holding	her	neck,
pulling	 her	 hips	 into	 yours.	 One	 of	 my	 favorite	 things	 to	 do	 while	 making	 out
with	a	girl	is	to	grab	her	belt	loops	on	her	pants	and	pull	her	hips	into	mine.

Don’t	 get	 ahead	 of	 yourself	 when	 you’re	 kissing.	 Too	 many	 men	 start	 making
out	 with	 a	 woman	 and	 then	 immediately	 go	 into	 “OK,	 LET’S	 FUCK”	 mode
where	they	practically	start	molesting	her	wherever	they	are	and	devouring	her
face.

Cool	it.	Kissing	is	simply	the	gateway	to	greater	and	deeper	intimacy.	Enjoy	it,
play	with	it,	relax	into	it.

Moving	Forward	and	Consent

So	you’ve	kissed	her.	Now	what?

Assuming	you’re	in	a	discrete	place,	you’ve	both	gotten	to	know	each	other,	and
you’re	 both	 “fuck	 yes”	 about	 going	 further,	 then	 it’s	 time	 to	 escalate	 things
towards	sex.

Usually,	the	place	to	touch	a	woman	that	indicates	you’re	ready	for	sex	and	that
isn’t	acceptable	unless	she	is	as	well	are	her	breasts.	If	your	hands	find	your	way

to	them	and	she’s	into	it,	then	this	is	usually	an	indication	that	things	are	going	to
go	further.

But	believe	it	or	not,	women	don’t	just	want	to	drop	their	pants	and	screw	right
there	on	the	spot.	Whereas	men	are	like	a	microwave	that	you	just	press	a	button
and	the	food	is	ready	to	go,	women	are	like	an	oven.	They	need	to	be	warmed
up,	 pre-heated	 even.	 Remember,	 female	 arousal	 is	 primarily	 psychological.
Therefore,	there	needs	to	be	a	sense	of	build-up	to	sex.	You	don’t	just	go	from
kissing	 to	 screwing	 (some	 women	 do,	 but	 typically	 not).	 Usually,	 you	 need	 to
build	up	from	light	touching,	to	kissing,	to	kissing	plus	roaming	hands,	to	some
clothes	off	and	more	touching,	and	so	on.

Women	will	often	object	at	this	point	and	say	they	just	want	to	mess	around	and
not	have	sex	itself.	The	correct	answer	to	any	objection	is	always,	“That’s	fine.
We’ll	do	whatever	you’re	comfortable	doing.”	The	point	is	to	have	an	enjoyable
experience,	not	to	get	more	notches	on	your	bedpost.

Yes,	women	often	say,	“We’re	not	going	to	have	sex	tonight,”	and	then	go	ahead
and	have	sex.	And	that’s	fine	too.	Just	accept	that	these	things	are	often	fluid	and
both	you	and	her	can	opt	in	or	opt	out	at	any	time	without	shame	or	judgment.

A	quick	note	about	rape	because	unfortunately	I	have	to	put	something	in	here:
remember,	our	general	guideline	here	is	that	we	continue	until	a	woman	makes
us	 stop.	 This	 means	 she	 physically	 stops	 you	 —	 i.e.,	 moves	 your	 hands	 off	 of
her,	 moves	 away	 from	 you,	 puts	 her	 clothes	 back	 on,	 etc.	 —	 or	 clearly	 and
verbally	says,	“STOP!”	or	“NO!”

If	 she’s	 incapacitated	 to	 the	 point	 (drunk,	 drugs,	 etc.)	 where	 she	 probably
couldn’t	opt	out	or	make	a	clear	decision,	then	you	should	stop.	End	of	story.

Physicality	is	something	you	have	to	practice	and	become	comfortable	at.	Every
man	develops	his	own	style	and	personality	to	how	he	likes	to	touch,	where	he
likes	to	touch,	how	he	likes	to	move	things	forward.	And	as	you	develop	your
own	 style	 of	 physicality,	 you	 will	 begin	 to	 get	 a	 sense	 for	 when	 women	 are
comfortable	with	what.	The	important	thing	is	to	see	sex	as	not	something	you
are	 earning	 or	 taking	 from	 a	 woman,	 but	 rather	 something	 you	 two	 are
participating	 in	 together.	 It’s	 a	 team	 effort.	 Because,	 believe	 it	 or	 not,	 women
want	sex	too.	They	want	wild,	passionate,	crazy	sex,	just	like	you	do.

Sex

Oh	my	God	bro,	you’re	totally	going	to	get	laid	tonight!

No,	 seriously.	 Once	 you’ve	 got	 some	 clothes	 off	 and	 you’re	 both	 on	 a	 bed,	 a
couch,	the	bathroom	floor	—	or	wherever	you	plan	on	doing	the	dirty	—	you’ve
now	entered	the	realm	of	foreplay.	Sadly,	men	overlook	foreplay	because	we’re
just	 too	 damn	 excited	 about	 getting	 our	 dicks	 wet.	 The	 more	 foreplay	 there	 is,
the	hotter	your	woman’s	going	to	be,	the	better	sex	she’s	going	to	have,	which
means	the	better	sex	you’ll	have	(this	is	a	team	sport,	remember?)

A	good	place	to	start	is	by	sucking	and	massaging	her	bare	breasts.	Some	girls
who	like	it	rougher	like	it	when	you	gently	bite	on	their	nipples,	but	be	careful,
not	every	girl	is	into	that.

From	there,	you	should	at	least	finger	her	or	rub	her	clitoris.	Feel	how	wet	she	is.
If	 she’s	 wet,	 then	 slowly	 keep	 moving	 things	 forward.	 If	 she’s	 dry	 then	 slow
down	and	take	your	time.	She	needs	more	time	to	get	warmed	up.

If	you	enjoy	giving	girls	oral	sex,	this	is	an	excellent	time	to	do	that	as	well.	If
you	give	good	oral	sex,	most	girls	won’t	be	able	to	resist	the	urge	to	have	sex
then	and	there	(some	will	even	grab	you	and	make	you	do	it).

The	 most	 important	 thing	 to	 keep	 in	 mind	 about	 foreplay	 is	 the	 concept	 of
teasing	or	expectation.	As	you	do	the	things	talked	about	above,	don’t	just	rush
into	them	and	devour	her.	That	can	be	cool	sometimes,	but	in	general,	you	want
to	take	things	slow,	create	a	drawn-out	and	sensual	experience.	Girls	love	to	be
teased.	For	instance,	instead	of	just	shoving	your	finger	inside	her	and	going	at
it,	trying	lightly	touching	her	pussy	with	your	fingertips	for	a	few	seconds.	She’ll
go	crazy	and	want	you	inside	her	more	than	ever.

Instead	 of	 just	 giving	 her	 oral	 sex,	 start	 off	 slow	 by	 kissing	 the	 inside	 of	 her
thighs,	 inching	 closer	 and	 closer.	 Create	 expectation.	 Make	 her	 yearn	 for
whatever	you’re	about	to	do	to	her.	Stuff	like	this	drives	girls	crazy	and	makes
them	incredibly	horny.	If	you	do	this	well	and	repeatedly,	you’ll	often	get	girls
pushing	you	 down	 and	 forcing	 you	 to	 have	 sex.	 The	 expectation	 is	 too	 much.
They	have	to	have	it.	Right	then	and	there.

When	it	comes	to	sex,	more	important	than	any	physical	technique	—	some	cool
angle	 or	 position	 or	 whatever	 —	 is	 being	 dominant.	 Sexual	 gratification	 for

women	is	far	more	psychological	than	it	is	physical,	whereas	for	men	it’s	mostly
physical.	A	large	component	of	this	psychological	satisfaction	comes	from	being
dominated	and	surrendering	control.	Women	like	to	feel	like	you	have	the	power
and	the	control	in	the	bedroom.	They	want	you	to	be	assertive	and	strong	with
what	you	want.	So	how	do	you	become	dominant	in	bed?

1.	 Be	 loud.	 Make	 noise.	 Grunt.	 Breathe	 hard.	 Women	 love	 this	 because	 it
makes	them	feel	like	they	can	be	loud.	And	when	they’re	loud	they	get	off
easier	and	more	often.

2.	Talk	dirty.	Tell	her	how	sexy	she	is.	Tell	her	what	you’re	going	to	do	to
her	 before	 you	 do	 it.	 Call	 her	 a	 dirty	 girl	 and	 a	 horny	 slut.	 This	 may	 be
outside	 of	 your	 comfort	 zone,	 but	 realize	 that	 in	 the	 bedroom	 the	 rules
change	and	logic	goes	out	the	window.

3.	 Get	 physical.	 Spank	 her.	 Pull	 her	 hair.	 Hold	 her	 down	 with	 one	 hand.
When	you	change	positions,	literally	pick	her	up	and	move	her	yourself.

4.	Don’t	ever	ask,	“Is	this	OK?	Do	you	want	to	do	X?”	Just	do	it	and	stop
later	if	she	doesn’t	like	it	and	apologize.	Nothing	turns	a	girl	off	faster	than
a	guy	who	defers	to	her	too	much	while	having	sex.	Take	control.	Do	what
turns	you	on	and	that	will	then	turn	her	on.

The	most	important	habit	to	develop,	by	far,	is	to	talk	and	be	expressive	in	the
bedroom.	There	has	to	be	an	open	forum	of	communication	when	you	sleep	with
a	woman,	especially	the	first	few	times	you’re	together.	Sex	is	always	somewhat
awkward	the	first	time	you’re	with	a	new	person.	Everybody	engages	in	different
practices,	habits	and	prefers	different	things.	It	takes	a	while	to	learn	each	other’s
tendencies	and	adapt	to	one	another’s	likes	and	dislikes.

This	 requires	 you	 to	 have	 a	 sense	 of	 humor	 in	 the	 bedroom.	 Goofy	 and	 weird
moments	 are	 going	 to	 happen	 in	 the	 sack	 and	 most	 people	 are	 at	 their	 most
insecure	when	they’re	naked	and	lying	under	someone	they	just	met	a	week	ago.

Have	a	sense	of	humor.	Be	understanding.	Relax.

One	of	my	favorite	jokes	in	the	bedroom,	when	stuff	goes	awry,	is,	“They	make
it	look	so	easy	in	the	movies.”	If	you	can	get	a	girl	to	crack	up,	she’ll	forget	she’s
naked,	forget	she’s	in	a	strange	position	and	forget	that	you	just	screwed	up	and
just	be	with	you,	laughing	with	you.

Also,	be	honest.	If	you	don’t	like	the	way	she	gives	a	blowjob,	tell	her	and	then
tell	 her	 how	 you	 do	 like	 it.	 But	 also,	 be	 honest	 with	 the	 compliments.	 Tell	 her
she’s	 beautiful	 naked.	 Tell	 her	 you	 love	 how	 she	 rides	 you.	 Tell	 her	 she	 looks
sexy	in	that	position.

Be	 open	 and	 honest.	 Communicate.	 The	 most	 important	 factor	 for	 good	 sex	 is
how	 comfortable	 the	 two	 people	 are	 around	 each	 other.	 (This	 is	 another
argument	for	practicing	vulnerability,	by	the	way.)

A	 lot	 of	 men	 feel	 anxious	 around	 sexuality	 and	 actually	 get	 nervous	 once	 they
know	they’re	going	to	have	it.	But	if	you	bring	up	sexual	anxiety,	almost	every
guy	will	laugh	and	say,	“Must	suck	for	that	guy,”	as	if	they	don’t	have	any.	The
rotten	truth	is	that	most	of	us	have	some	form	of	it	or	another.	There	are	a	variety
of	causes	for	sexual	anxiety,	but	the	most	common	are:

-	Inexperience
-	Strict	religious	and/or	cultural	upbringing
-	Negative	past	sexual	experiences
-	Past	emotional	trauma
-	Low	self-esteem

Ultimately,	 the	 causes	 of	 sexual	 anxiety	 are	 directly	 related	 to	 other	 forms	 of
anxiety:	 lack	 of	 confidence,	 high	 investment	 in	 others,	 shame,	 and	 a	 fear	 of
vulnerability.

There	are	two	symptoms,	and	you	either	have	one	or	the	other.	You	either	cum
way	too	fast	(less	than	a	minute	or	two)	or	you	either	can’t	get	hard	or	you	can’t
keep	it	hard.

But	that	doesn’t	make	sense.	How	can	two	completely	opposite	phenomena	be
caused	by	the	same	thing?

It’s	 basically	 a	 permutation	 of	 the	 “fight	 or	 flight”	 response.	 The	 idea	 is	 that
when	 you	 become	 nervous	 and	 adrenaline	 is	 released,	 your	 body	 wants	 to	 get
itself	into	a	protected	and	safe	position	as	soon	as	possible.	One	way	to	do	this	is
to	ejaculate	immediately.	The	other	is	to	lose	your	erection	entirely.

Either	way,	these	problems	suck.	I’m	not	sure	which	one’s	worse.	But	we	have
ways	to	combat	this	problem.

If	you	finish	way	too	quickly,	try	finding	a	thicker	condom.	They	actually	make
condoms	 now	 that	 purposely	 numb	 your	 penis	 so	 that	 you	 can	 last	 longer.	 Try
masturbating	a	few	hours	before	you	expect	to	have	sex.

If	you	have	trouble	getting	it	up	or	keeping	it	up,	get	pills.	Seriously,	there	are
herbal	 supplements	 that	 you	 can	 buy	 over	 the	 counter	 that	 act	 similarly	 to
Viagra.	 They	 make	 you	 hard	 as	 an	 ox	 and	 able	 to	 go	 multiple	 times.	 Take	 a
couple	before	you	get	intimate	with	a	girl	and	you	shouldn’t	have	any	problems
keeping	it	at	attention.

But	these	remedies	are	merely	Band-Aid	solutions	for	a	larger	problem.

The	larger	problem	is	not	being	completely	comfortable	with	your	sexuality	and
having	 sex.	 It’s	 once	 again	 a	 vulnerability	 issue.	 This	 problem	 reaches	 much
deeper	 and	 lurks	 within	 our	 subconscious.	 The	 most	 obvious	 solution	 is	 to
simply	have	as	much	sex	as	possible.	Getting	a	steady	girlfriend	is	the	best	way
to	do	this.

Unfortunately,	if	you	want	to	stay	single,	this	will	take	a	lot	of	time	and	effort.
And	you	have	to	deal	with	a	lot	of	demoralizing	failures.	Try	taking	it	slow	with
the	girl	once	you	know	you’re	going	to	have	sex	with	her.

Think	of	it	as	having	to	make	yourself	more	secure	and	comfortable	around	her
until	you’re	able	to	have	sex.	I	know	it	sounds	lame,	but	it’s	true.	Slow	things
down,	 enjoy	 the	 foreplay	 more,	 and	 don’t	 pressure	 yourself	 to	 get	 to	 it	 until
you’re	good	and	ready.

Practice	 closing	 your	 eyes	 and	 relaxing	 when	 you	 know	 you’ll	 be	 having	 sex
with	 her.	 If	 you	 have	 trouble	 with	 getting	 too	 excited,	 think	 about	 something
non-sexual	like	baseball	or	video	games.	If	you	have	trouble	getting	it	up,	relax
and	just	look	at	her	and	think	about	how	sexy	she	is.

If	 you	 feel	 that	 you	 have	 some	 sort	 of	 emotional	 trauma	 in	 your	 past	 or	 were
raised	 in	 a	 seriously	 sexually	 repressed	 environment,	 consider	 seeking
counseling	or	therapy.

Regardless,	 once	 you’ve	 reached	 this	 point,	 you’ve	 reached	 the	 point	 of
maximum	 vulnerability	 with	 one	 person.	 Typically,	 women	 become	 more
invested	after	sex	and	men	become	less	invested	after	sex.	The	power	dynamic
in	most	couples	will	switch	at	this	point.	The	power	of	choice	that	the	 woman

had	(whether	to	have	sex	or	not)	now	usually	switches	over	to	the	man	(whether
to	 commit	 or	 not).	 If	 this	 power	 dynamic	 doesn’t	 switch,	 it’s	 usually	 a	 sign	 of
neediness	in	the	man,	and	the	attraction	will	not	last.

Vulnerability	 need	 not	 be	 confused	 with	 commitment	 or	 attachment.	 It’s	 still
possible	 to	 experience	 an	 intense	 and	 powerful	 emotional	 connection	 with	 a
woman	and	never	desire	long-term	commitment	with	one	another.

But	at	the	same	time,	this	sort	of	vulnerability	and	intimacy	is	often	the	starting
point	 of	 an	 attachment	 within	 most	 of	 us	 that	 will	 never	 go	 away.	 To	 this	 day,
women	 I	 have	 slept	 with	 exist	 within	 a	 separate	 category	 of	 friendship	 and
loyalty	in	my	mind,	even	if	I	didn’t	end	up	dating	them.

While	intimacy,	romance,	and	intense	emotional	connection	are	fantastic	and	in
many	 ways	 intoxicating,	 like	 a	 drug	 and	 even	 possibly	 addictive,	 true,	 long-
lasting	 emotional	 connection	 can	 only	 come	 through	 submitting	 to	 long-term
commitment.	But	that	is	a	topic	for	another	book.

Closing

Conclusion:	Moving	Ahead

There’s	a	lot	to	digest	in	this	book.	And	if	you’re	a	first-timer	who	hasn’t	started
his	journey	of	self-improvement	to	become	more	attractive	to	women,	it’s	easy
to	get	overwhelmed	and	wonder	where	to	start.

That’s	why	I’ve	put	together	this	small	Action	Plan	at	the	end	of	the	book,	to	not
only	give	you	a	clear	place	to	start	but	also	help	you	see	what	you	should	focus
on	and	in	which	order.

The	 Action	 Plan	 is	 divided	 up	 into	 sections	 of	 five	 tasks	 or	 challenges.	 Once
you’ve	completed	at	least	four	of	the	tasks	in	each	section,	move	on	to	the	next
section.	In	Section	1,	some	tasks	you	will	naturally	have	handled.	For	instance,	if
you	 already	 work	 out	 regularly,	 then	 that’s	 fine.	 In	 other	 sections,	 an	 item
doesn’t	count	unless	you	do	it	since	starting	that	section.	For	instance,	in	Section
5,	 you’re	 challenged	 to	 have	 sex	 with	 a	 woman	 you’ve	 never	 had	 sex	 with
before.	Obviously,	not	everyone	reading	this	is	a	virgin.	Some	of	you	may	even
have	sex	with	a	woman	in	previous	sections.	But	it	doesn’t	count	until	you	get	to
section	5.

Obviously,	these	aren’t	rigid	rules.	But	the	sections	are	laid	out	here	to	challenge
you	 and	 give	 you	 clearly	 defined	 goals	 and	 benchmarks	 to	 strive	 for.	 In	 all
sections,	 some	 tasks	 will	 be	 very	 easy	 for	 you.	 Others	 will	 be	 very	 difficult.	 It
will	 vary	 from	 person	 to	 person,	 but	 the	 idea	 is	 to	 give	 you	 a	 general	 path	 to
follow	when	it	comes	to	improving	yourself.

Also	 realize,	 that	 this	 is	 a	 long-term	 process.	 A	 lot	 of	 these	 tasks	 won’t	 be
completed	in	one	night	or	even	in	one	weekend.	A	lot	of	them	will	require	weeks
or	 months	 of	 effort.	 But	 that’s	 OK.	 That	 means	 you	 probably	 really	 needed	 to
work	on	it.

Level	1:	Your	Foundation	(Complete	5	of	5)

Join	a	gym:	If	you’re	not	already	a	member	of	a	gym,	join	one.	If	you’re	not
familiar	with	how	to	work	out	properly,	hire	a	personal	trainer.	Make	this	a
weekly	habit.

Upgrade	your	wardrobe:	Go	out	and	upgrade	your	wardrobe	based	on	the

recommendations	 in	 Chapter	 8.	 Challenge	 yourself	 to	 wear	 nicer	 clothes
than	you’ve	ever	worn	before.	It’ll	change	how	you	feel	about	yourself.

Get	 a	 nice	 haircut:	 Go	 to	 a	 salon	 and	 drop	 the	 $50	 on	 it.	 It’s	 worth	 it.	 It
makes	a	difference.

Job	security/satisfaction:	This	is	a	complicated	one,	but	if	you’re	not	happy
with	 your	 work	 situation,	 take	 some	 time	 and	 plan	 a	 way	 to	 fix	 it.	 If	 you
work	too	much,	try	to	find	a	way	to	work	less.	If	you’re	unemployed,	stop
everything	else	and	get	a	job.

Pursue	 one	 social	 hobby	 regularly:	 Pick	 a	 social	 hobby	 and	 pursue	 it
regularly.	You	may	already	have	one,	but	if	not,	find	one.	It	could	be	dance
classes,	public	speaking	courses,	language	courses,	cooking	classes,	joining
a	band,	etc.	Whatever	it	is,	make	it	social.	That	means	sitting	at	home	and
perfecting	your	model	airplanes	doesn’t	count.

Level	2:	Meeting	Women	(Complete	4	of	5)

Figure	 out	 demographics:	 Figure	 out	 your	 demographics	 based	 on	 the
recommendations	in.	Write	down	the	type	of	women	you’d	like	to	meet	and
the	places	you	enjoy	 going	 most.	 Then	find	venues	 or	events	 where	 those
two	things	intersect.	It	could	be	independent	rock	concerts,	it	could	be	art
gallery	 showings,	 it	 could	 be	 salsa	 nights.	 Whatever	 it	 is,	 find	 your	 niche
and	pursue	it.

Meet	5	women	in	one	day:	Self-explanatory

Meet	20	women	in	one	week:	Also	self-explanatory.

Join	 an	 online	 dating	 site	 and	 email	 10	 women:	 Also	 self-explanatory.	 If
you’re	under	30	years	old,	I	recommend	free	dating	sites.	If	you’re	over	30
years	old,	I	recommend	pay	sites.

Sign	up	for	a	singles	or	speed	dating	event:	If	you	have	trouble	doing	the
approaching	 tasks,	 then	 this	 may	 give	 you	 a	 needed	 boost	 in	 the	 right
direction.

Level	3:	Getting	to	Know	Women	(Complete	2	of	3)

Level	6:	Oh,	You	Mack	Daddy,	You	(Optional)

Have	sex	with	a	woman	you	met	that	same	day/night:	Again,	recommended
you	 do	 this	 with	 a	 woman	 you	 meet	 in	 a	 bar	 or	 nightclub.	 Bringing	 a
woman	home	you	meet	during	the	day	is	more	difficult,	but	not	impossible.

Have	sex	with	a	woman	on	the	first	date:	Make	sure	it’s	a	damn	good	date.

Kiss	 three	 women	 the	 day/night	 you	 meet	 them:	 Can	 be	 done	 on	 separate
nights.	Also	recommended	to	do	this	at	a	bar	or	nightclub.

Epilogue:
What	If	It	Was	A	Gift?

Over	 the	 course	 of	 the	 previous	 230	 pages,	 we’ve	 discovered	 that	 attraction
flows	 from	 women	 perceiving	 non-neediness	 and	 a	 sense	 of	 inner	 security	 in
men.	 This	 confidence	 and	 security	 arise	 from	 having	 a	 stronger	 identity	 and
investment	 in	 oneself	 than	 in	 the	 perception	 of	 others.	 This	 sub-communicates
that	as	a	man,	you’re	dependable,	confident	and	high	status	(or	likely	to	become
high	status).

The	way	to	cultivate	a	higher	investment	in	oneself,	the	way	to	becoming	more
confident,	 is	 actually	 counterintuitive.	 We	 learned	 that	 showing	 vulnerability,
both	in	emotion	and	action,	actually	leads	to	a	higher	investment	in	oneself	and
higher	non-neediness.

This	newfound	confidence	then	allows	you	to	express	yourself	more	clearly	and
directly.	When	you	express	yourself	more	clearly	and	directly,	you	polarize	the
reactions	 of	 women,	 opening	 yourself	 up	 to	 more	 rejection,	 but	 also	 attracting
other	 women	 stronger	 than	 ever	 before.	 Attracting	 women	 occurs	 through	 a
process	of	self-selection.	The	rate	at	which	you	attract	them	happens	through	a
process	 of	 overcoming	 fear.	 And	 the	 consistency	 in	 which	 you	 seduce	 those
women	attracted	happens	through	a	process	of	expressing	your	sexuality.	These
are	the	three	fundamentals.

Presented	 in	 these	 pages	 are	 all	 of	 the	 tools	 I	 can	 ever	 imagine	 a	 man	 ever
needing	 to	 renovate	 himself	 and	 become	 more	 successful	 with	 women.
Undoubtedly	for	you,	it	will	be	difficult	at	times.	You	will	run	into	speed	bumps,
detours,	 distractions,	 and	 emotional	 highs	 lows.	 But	 if	 you	 persist	 and	 stay
optimistic,	you	will	get	there.	I’m	absolutely	sure	of	it.

And	in	those	times	that	it	does	become	difficult,	those	times	where	you	do	get
frustrated	 and	 fall	 back	 to	 your	 unconfident	 beliefs,	 your	 desire	 for	 external
validation,	where	you	let	yourself	become	swayed	by	the	whims	of	others	rather
than	 your	 internal	 compass,	 you	 may	 feel	 lost	 or	 hopeless.	 This	 feeling	 of
hopelessness	 may	 last	 for	 minutes,	 hours	 or	 days,	 but	 chances	 are	 if	 you	 push
yourself,	if	you	genuinely	try	to	change	yourself	and	re-orient	how	you	interact
with	the	world,	then	you	will	feel	it	at	some	point.

And	 for	 those	 times,	 let	 me	 share	 with	 you	 a	 phrase	 that	 has	 helped	 me	 and
countless	other	men	through	those	dire	straits.

The	phrase	comes	from	Dr.	Robert	Glover	and	his	book	No	More	Mr.	Nice	Guy,
one	of	the	best	books	I’ve	ever	read	on	men’s	emotional	health	and	development.

The	phrase	is:	“What	if	it	was	a	gift?”

Whatever	happens	to	you,	no	matter	how	bad,	no	matter	how	bleak	you	feel,	ask
yourself,	“What	if	it	was	a	gift?”	and	then	try	to	rationalize	a	way	it	could	be	so.

Because	 you	 see,	 in	 the	 world	 of	 emotions,	 there	 are	 no	 absolutes;	 you	 can
usually	 draw	 whichever	 conclusions	 you	 desire.	 So	 why	 not	 choose	 to	 draw
conclusions	of	blessings,	positivity,	and	gifts?

Ex-girlfriend	 dumps	 you	 and	 left	 you	 for	 another	 man.	 What	 if	 it	 was	 a	 gift?
Because	 without	 her,	 you	 would	 not	 have	 been	 put	 on	 this	 path	 of	 self-
improvement,	 and	 you	 would	 have	 forever	 been	 stuck	 in	 a	 relationship	 full	 of
deceit	and	without	self-awareness.

A	woman	makes	fun	of	your	hair	and	calls	you	ugly.	What	if	it	was	a	gift?	Such
a	harsh	rejection	will	steel	you	into	becoming	even	more	confident	in	the	future,
and	hopefully,	will	inspire	you	to	re-evaluate	how	you	look.

Your	friends	tell	you	that	approaching	women	is	creepy	and	that	you’re	a	loser
for	wanting	to	do	it.	What	if	it	was	a	gift?	It	shows	that	what	you’re	doing	and
what	 you’re	 working	 on	 is	 pushing	 social	 boundaries,	 is	 polarizing,	 and	 is
ultimately	making	you	more	controversial	and	attractive.

When	I	was	19	years	old,	a	friend	of	mine	drowned	right	in	front	of	me.	We	were
at	a	party	on	a	lake.	One	minute	he	was	there,	laughing,	smiling,	joking,	and	the
next	moment	he	was	gone.	Forever.

It	was	one	of	the	biggest	gifts	I’ve	ever	been	given.	Not	because	it	was	good.	It
was	tragic.	But	because	of	how	it	affected	me	ever	since.

Obviously,	that	night	was	shocking	and	traumatizing.	But	I	came	away	from	the
experience	with	a	keen	awareness	of	how	transient	this	existence	is.	How	any	of
us	can	be	taken	at	any	moment.	How	no	one	is	going	to	live	my	life	for	me,	and
every	 second	 I	 spend	 sitting	 around	 feeling	 distant	 from	 my	 true	 desires,

avoiding	the	world	and	being	afraid	to	engage	it,	is	a	second	that	I’m	forfeiting
the	biggest	gift	of	all:	my	time	here	in	this	life.

His	death	shocked	me,	depressed	me	and	scared	me,	but	it	scared	me	into	having
the	courage	to	take	risks,	to	express	myself,	to	invest	in	my	self-perception	more
than	 the	 perceptions	 of	 others.	 Because	 after	 all,	 sooner	 or	 later	 this	 will	 all
disappear,	and	none	of	it	will	matter.	So	you	might	as	well	make	the	most	of	it
while	you’re	here.

And	 ultimately,	 that’s	 all	 that	 I	 can	 hope	 for	 you.	 That	 you	 make	 the	 most	 of
your	time	here.	That	you	take	the	tools	I’ve	laid	out	here	and	go	out	and	forge	a
unique	 path	 for	yourself	and	experience	the	love,	the	 thrills,	and	the	happiness
that	this	life	can	reward	you.

Because	that	is	what	life	does:	it	rewards	you.	It’s	giving	you	gifts	every	day.

Are	you	going	to	accept	them?

esteem.	 A	 man	 with	a	 positive	attitude	towards	sex	will	attract	women	with
positive	attitudes	towards	sex.	See	Also:	Demographics

Attractive	Behavior	—	Confident	behavior,	both	in	one’s	everyday	life,	as	well
as	 direct	 interactions	 with	 women.	 Attractive	 behavior	 is	 usually	 a	 result	 of
vulnerability,	although	not	always.	See	Also:	Lifestyle,	Neediness

Boundaries	 —	 The	 limit	 of	 interaction	 and	 communication	 one	 finds
acceptable.	 Boundaries	 can	 be	 strong	 or	 weak	 based	 upon	 the	 person’s
confidence	 level.	 For	 instance,	 John	 lacks	 confidence	 and	 therefore	 lets	 his
dates	 make	 fun	 of	 him	 without	 saying	 anything.	 Sally	 has	 high	 confidence
and	 does	 not	 tolerate	 her	 date	 being	 20	 minutes	 late	 to	 pick	 her	 up.	 Strong
boundaries	 are	 both	 a	 cause	 and	 effect	 of	 True	 Confidence.	 Standing	 up	 for
one’s	 boundaries	 often	 triggers	 attraction	 and	 always	 generates	 greater
respect.	See	Also:	True	Confidence

Confidence	—	One’s	belief	in	themselves	and	their	ability	and	competence	in	a
certain	situation.	Confidence	is	context-dependent.	One	can	be	confident	in	a
boardroom	 but	 horribly	 unconfident	 in	 a	 sexual	 relationship.	 Confidence	 is
often	confused	with	self-esteem.	Lack	of	confidence	in	romantic	situations	is
a	reflection	of	neediness,	which	is	a	component	of	low	self-esteem.	Confident
behavior	 is	 always	 attractive.	 See	 Also:	 Non-Neediness,	 Neediness,	 Self-
Esteem

Courage	 —	 The	 ability	 to	 perform	 an	 action	 despite	 feeling	 fear	 and	 anxiety

about	doing	it.	See	Also:	Anxiety

Creepy	 —	 To	 express	 one’s	 sexuality	 in	 such	 a	 way	 that	 makes	 a	 woman
uncomfortable	 or	 less	 secure.	 Creepy	 behavior	 can	 happen	 consciously	 or
unconsciously.	See	Also:	Sexual	Intent,	Flirting

Dating	 Success	 —	 Maximizing	 one’s	 happiness	 with	 the	 woman/women	 one
chooses.	It	is	important	to	note	that	it	is	NOT	determined	by	numbers,	sexual
encounters,	appearances,	etc.,	but	by	happiness.

Defense	Mechanisms	 —	 Psychological	 reactions	 to	 anxiety	 that	 cause	 one	 to
include	 blame,	 anger,	 projection,

taking	 action.	 Examples

avoid
rationalizations,	apathy,	etc.	See	Also:	Anxiety,	Courage

Demographics	—	The	idea	that	you	will	experience	greater	success	(happiness)
and	efficiency	by	pursuing	 women	in	areas	of	your	life	 that	you	excel	 at	or
enjoy.	 For	 instance,	 if	 you	 are	 a	 musician,	 then	 you	 are	 more	 likely	 to
experience	 dating	 success	 by	 meeting	 women	 at	 concerts	 and	 music	 events.
See	Also:	Assortment	Effect,	Lifestyle

Emotional	Connection	—	A	mutual	emotional	investment	between	two	people.
This	 investment	 generates	 a	 feeling	 of	 closeness	 and	 greater	 empathy.	 Can
often	trigger	arousal	and	sexual	desire.

Finding	Your	Truth	—	A	two-part	process	of	1)	removing	behaviors	which	are
based	on	receiving	the	approval	of	others	rather	than	your	own	values	and	2)
getting	 in	 touch	 with	 emotions	 and	 desires	 which	 were	 previously
unconscious.	 Finding	 one’s	 truth	 is	 based	 on	 the	 idea	 that	 most	 of	 our
behaviors	 and	 beliefs	 are	 actually	 unconscious	 habits	 we	 picked	 up	 for	 the
wrong	reasons	throughout	our	lives.	Getting	in	touch	with	one’s	real	emotions
and	desires	and	discarding	the	unconfident	habits	and	behaviors	leads	one	to
become	more	vulnerable,	more	confident,	and,	therefore,	more	attractive.	See
Also:	Attractive	Behavior,	Non-Neediness,	Vulnerability

Flake	—	A	specific	form	of	rejection.	When	a	woman	demonstrates	interest	or

says	she	will	see	you	again	and	then	never	does.

Flirting	 —	 The	 demonstration	 of	 sexual	 intent	 in	 a	 fun	 and	 playful	 manner.
Successful	 flirting	 makes	 women	 feel	 secure	 with	 your	 sexual	 intent.	 The

opposite	of	creepy.	See	Also:	Creepy,	Sexual	Intent

Friction	 —	 Circumstances	 and	 causes	 that	 prevent	 sexual	 escalation	 from
occurring	despite	there	being	mutual	attraction.	For	instance,	two	people	may
be	 very	 attracted	 to	 one	 another,	 but	 one	 is	 married	 and	 the	 other	 lives	 in
another	town.

Honest	Action	—	Removing	the	separation	between	what	one	desires	to	do	and
what	one	actually	does.	Usually	involves	overcoming	one’s	own	anxieties	and
limiting	beliefs	about	what	is	possible.

Honest	 Communication	 —	 Removing	 the	 separation	 between	 what	 one
believes	 and	 feels	 and	 what	 one	 says.	 Requires	 a	 removal	 of	 inhibitions	 as
well	as	a	clarity	to	one’s	communication.

Honest	Living	—	Removing	the	separation	between	the	person	you	desire	to	be
and	 the	 person	 you	 actually	 are.	 Requires	 long-term	 investment	 and	 often
major	life	decisions/changes.

Lifestyle	—	A	blanket	term	for	the	quality	and	types	of	activities,	interests	and
people	one	spends	the	majority	of	their	time	with.	Your	profession,	the	place
you	 live,	 hobbies,	 friends,	 and	 weekend	 trips	 are	 all	 components	 of	 your
overall	lifestyle.	Your	lifestyle	is	a	reflection	of	your	values	and	self-esteem
and	 also	 determines	 your	 demographics.	 A	 lifestyle	 can	 be	 based	 upon
unconfident	behavior	(i.e.,	dressing	a	certain	way	or	driving	a	certain	car	in
order	to	impress	women).	See	Also:	Demographics

Limiting	 Beliefs	 —	 Irrational	 beliefs	 that	 inherently	 prevent	 one	 from	 being
successful	at	something.	Limiting	beliefs	are	almost	always	untrue	and	results
of	 defense	 mechanisms	 and	 a	 lack	 of	 courage.	 An	 example	 is	 a	 man	 who
believes	 that	 women	 will	 never	 be	 attracted	 to	 him	 because	 he’s	 bald	 so	 he
doesn’t	even	try.	See	Also:	Defense	Mechanisms,	Courage

Narcissism	 -	 Men	 who	 overcompensate	 for	 their	 low	 self-esteem	 and	 lack	 of
confidence	 by	 imposing	 their	 will	 and	 needs	 onto	 others	 unnecessarily.
Narcissism	 is	 often	 preoccupied	 with	 sleeping	 with	 as	 many	 women	 as
possible.	 Narcissistic	 behavior	 is	 often	 promoted	 within	 the	 Pick	 Up	 Artist
industry	 and	 the	 so-called	 “red	 pill”	 community.	 Narcissistic	 behavior	 can
come	 across	 as	 confident	 but	 is	 still	 low-status	 behavior	 because	 it	 is	 over-
invested	 in	 the	 perceptions	 of	 others.	 Men	 who	 are	 narcissistic	 experience

short-term	 sexual	 success	 but	 long-term	 emotional	 failure.	 See	 Also:	 Self-
Esteem,	Non-Neediness,	Pick	Up	Artist

Neediness	—	Being	more	invested	in	the	opinions	and	perceptions	of	others	than
your	 opinion	 and	 perception	 of	 yourself.	 Needy	 men	 end	 up	 deferring	 all
decision-making	 and	 behaviors	 to	 what	 they	 will	 believe	 will	 win	 them
approval	from	others.	They	will	subvert	their	own	identity	and	desires	for	the
will	of	others.	Neediness	is	a	defense	mechanism	for	social/emotional	failures
early	in	life	but	is	a	failing	strategy	for	intimacy	in	 adulthood.	 Neediness	is
overcome	through	investing	in	oneself,	practicing	vulnerability,	and	pursuing
Honest	Living,	Honest	Action,	and	Honest	Communication.

Non-neediness	 —	 Being	 more	 invested	 in	 your	 opinion	 of	 yourself	 than	 the
opinions	others	have	of	you.	Non-neediness	is	one	component	of	having	high
self-esteem	 and	 the	 root	 of	 all	 attractive	 behavior.	 True	 Confidence	 is
achieved	 through	 practicing	 vulnerability	 and	 in	 investing	 in	 oneself.	 See
Also:	Confidence,	Neediness,	Self-Esteem

Objectification	 —	 The	 decision	 to	 view	 women	 and	 social	 interactions	 as
impersonal	processes	and	objects	rather	than	people	and	emotional	activities.
Seeing	women	as	numbers,	subjects	to	be	studied,	games	to	be	won,	etc.,	are
all	 common	 ways	 which	 men	 objectify	 their	 sexual	 and	 emotional	 lives.
Emotions	are	ignored	and	discouraged	from	being	expressed.	Narcissism	and
Performance	 behaviors	 both	 encourage	 objectification	 in	 order	 to	 achieve
short-term	 success.	 Objectification	 causes	 long-term	 emotional	 damage	 and
can	lead	to	depression	and	even	lower	levels	of	self-esteem.	This	is	the	reason
for	the	paradoxical	situation	many	long-time	narcissistic	men	find	themselves
in:	 they	 have	 many	 sexual	 partners	 but	 find	 themselves	 to	 actually	 be	 less
happy	 than	 they	 were	 when	 they	 started.	 See	 Also:	 Narcissism,	 Pick	 Up
Artists

Pain	 Period	 —	 The	 period	 of	 time	 when	 one	 begins	 to	 open	 themselves	 up
emotionally	and	make	themselves	more	vulnerable	to	others.	This	temporarily
causes	one	to	behave	in	a	less	attractive	manner	as	they	sort	through	years	of
emotional	baggage	and	trauma.	It’s	usually	a	period	accompanied	by	a	lot	of
emotional	stress	and	pain.	The	pain	period	is	necessary	to	go	from	a	low	self-
esteem	 and	 unconfident	 person	 to	 a	 high	 self-esteem	 and	 True	 Confidence
person.	See	Also:	Vulnerability,	Non-neediness

Pick	Up	Artist	—	A	school	of	dating	advice	based	on	the	teachings	of	Erik	von
Markovik	 (Mystery)	 and	 Neil	 Strauss	 (Style),	 as	 well	 as	 Real	 Social
Dynamics.	Pick	Up	Artists	are	characterized	by	their	own	specific	lingo	and
measurement	for	success,	which	is	getting	laid	as	much	as	possible.	Pick	Up
Artists	objectify	their	emotional	and	sexual	lives	and,	therefore,	cause	long-
term	 psychological	 damage	 to	 themselves	 despite	 often	 having	 sex	 with
women	 .	 Many	 Pick	 Up	 Artist	 teachings	 encourage	 Narcissism	 and

Objectification

behavior.

Polarization	 —	 Behavior	 that	 forces	 a	 woman	 to	 feel	 strongly	 about	 you,
whether	positive	or	negative.	Polarization	is	useful	for	screening	out	women
who	are	most	compatible	with	you	very	quickly.	Polarization	not	only	invites
rejection	but	uses	it	as	a	tool	to	achieve	dating	success	efficiently.	See	Also:
Assortment	Effect,	Demographics,	Rejection

Projection	—	A	common	defense	mechanism	used	by	both	men	and	women	to
avoid	anxiety.	Projection	is	when	you	perceive	the	source	of	your	anxiety	to
have	the	insecurity	rather	than	yourself.	For	instance,	an	Indian	man	who	is
insecure	 about	 his	 race	 will	 project	 onto	 the	 women	 he	 meets	 that	 they	 are
racist	 and	 don’t	 like	 him	 because	 he’s	 Indian.	 A	 man	 who	 is	 insecure	 about
women	being	mean	to	him	will	project	onto	women	who	intimidate	him	that
they	 are	 bitches	 and	 use	 that	 as	 a	 reason	 to	 avoid	 them.	 Women	 project	 as
well.	As	a	man,	it	is	possible	to	be	rejected	a	woman	who	is	very	attracted	to
you	because	she’s	insecure	or	uncomfortable	with	her	sexuality.	For	instance,
if	a	woman	is	low	self-esteem	and	perceives	you	to	be	too	attractive	for	her,
she	will	project	onto	you	that	insecurity	and	get	mad	at	you	for	only	wanting
her	for	sex.	This	is	the	reason	why	less	attractive	women	may	reject	you	more
often	 and	 harsher
than	 more	 attractive	 women.	 See	 Also:	 Defense
Mechanisms

Rejection	—	When	a	woman	demonstrates	a	lack	of	interest	in	a	man’s	sexual
intent.	Rejection	can	be	overt	(i.e.,	“I	have	a	boyfriend,	sorry,”)	or	subtle	(i.e.,
flaking,	going	to	the	bathroom	and	not	coming	back,	etc.).

Seduction	 -	 The	 process	 in	 which	 a	 man	 induces	 a	 woman	 to	 become	 more
highly	invested	in	him	than	he	is	in	her.	Sex	is	a	side	effect	of	this	process.
Women	are	generally	always	less	invested	at	the	beginning	of	an	interaction
because	they	almost	always	have	more	sexual	and	romantic	options	than	men

do.

Self-Esteem	—	One’s	unconscious	perception	of	their	own	value	or	self-worth.
Confidence	 in	 sexual	 interactions	 is	 one	 component	 of	 having	 high	 self-
esteem.	 For	 the	 sake	 of	 clarity,	 this	 book	 uses	 the	 term	 “non-neediness”	 in
place	of	self-esteem	in	most	cases	to	express	the	relational	component	of	self-
esteem.	See	Also:	Non-Neediness,	Attractive	Behavior,	Finding	Your	Truth

Self-Selection	 —	 The	 unconscious	 process	 of	 the	 assortment	 effect.	 Self-
Selection	is	the	idea	that	no	matter	what	you	do	or	who	you	are,	you	are	going
to	be	attractive	to	one	particular	demographic	and	unattractive	to	others.	For
instance,	 if	 you’re	 tall	 and	 bald,	 you’re	 going	 to	 unconsciously	 screen	 for
women	 who	 like	 tall,	 bald	 men	 for	 no	 other	 reason	 than	 women	 who	 don’t
will	 reject	 you	 or	 display	 no	 interest	 in	 you.	 If	 you’re	 a	 foreigner,	 then	 you
will	 automatically	 self-select	 for	 women	 who	 are	 interested	 in	 foreigners
without	having	to	do	anything.	Similar	to	the	assortment	effect,	but	instead	of
reflecting	beliefs	and	attitudes,	self-selection	reflects	superficial	preferences.

Sexual	 Anxiety	 —	 When	 one	 experiences	 apprehension	 and	 fear	 when
expressing	 their	 sexuality	 or	 when	 confronted	 with	 sexual	 situations.	 See
Also:	Courage,	Defense	Mechanisms

Sexual	Escalation	—	The	process	in	which	two	people	become	more	and	more
sexually	 engaged.	 Typically	 follows	 a	 pattern	 of	 light	 touching,	 to	 holding
and	heavy	touching,	to	kissing,	then	foreplay	and	eventually	sex.

Sexual	Intent	 —	 An	 expressed	 desire	 to	 have	 sexual	 relations	 with	 someone.
Can	 be	 overt	 and	 obvious	 or	 subtle	 and	 implied	 through	 flirting.	 See	 Also:
Creepy,	Flirting

Social	 Anxiety	 —	 When	 one	 experiences	 fear	 and	 apprehension	 in	 social
situations	 or	 when	 meeting	 new	 people.	 See	 Also:	 Courage,	 Defense
Mechanisms

Social	Circle	—	A	group	of	mutual	friends	and	acquaintances.

Social	Proof	—	The	psychological	mechanism	where	if	many	other	people	value
something,	then	we	will	value	it	as	well.	In	attraction,	the	theory	goes	that	if	a
number	 of	 other	 people	 or	 women	 are	 attracted	 to	 you,	 then	 one	 specific

woman	 will	 become	 more	 attracted	 to	 you.	 Only	 applicable	 in	 social	 circle
situations.	For	instance,	if	you	walk	into	a	bar	and	a	number	of	women	show
interest	 in	 you,	 then	 a	 woman	 on	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the	 bar	 who	 shares	 no
mutual	acquaintances	is	not	going	to	care.	But	if	you	walk	into	a	bar	and	three
of	a	woman’s	female	friends	know	you	and	like	you,	then	she	is	likely	to	be
attracted	to	you	before	you	even	speak	to	her.

Unconditionality	 —	 Performing	 an	 action	 or	 saying	 something	 with	 no
expectations	 of	 receiving	 anything	 in	 return.	 Men	 often	 do	 attractive
behaviors	 or	 nice	 things	 with	 the	 expectation	 that	 the	 girl	 now	 owes	 them
something	in	return.	A	common	example	is	he	will	compliment	her	with	the
expectation	that	she’s	supposed	to	be	nice	to	him	in	return.	This	is	conditional
behavior.	 Conditional	 behavior	 is	 unconfident	 and	 generally	 backfires	 and
makes	one	appear	less	attractive.	Unconditional	behavior	is	an	action	with	no
expectations	 for	 anything	 in	 return.	 Unconditionality	 is	 confident	 and
therefore	attractive.

Vulnerability	—	 Being	unguarded	or	undefended	in	expressing	one’s	thoughts
and	 emotions.	 Most	 men	 hide	 the	 thoughts	 and	 emotions	 they	 believe	 will
make	them	less	attractive.	This	forces	them	to	behave	conditionally	and	base
their	behaviors	on	the	beliefs	and	perceptions	of	those	around	 them.	This	is
unconfident	behavior	and	ultimately	makes	them	unattractive.	Paradoxically,
making	 oneself	 vulnerable	 and	 surrendering	 to	 criticism	 and	 not	 expecting
anything	in	return	from	others	causes	one	to	build	self-esteem,	become	more
confident	and	more	attractive.
