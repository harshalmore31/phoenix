Johnson in 1968\n.\n[\n13\n]\nBiden endorsed Harris,\n[\n14\n]\nwho was voted\nthe party's nominee\nby the delegates on August 5, 2024.

The Trump campaign was noted for making many\nfalse and misleading statements\n, including the claim that\nthe 2020 election was stolen\nfrom Trump,\n[\n18\n]\n[\n19\n]\n[\n20\n]\n[\n21\n]\nengaging in anti-immigrant\nfearmongering\n,\n[\nc\n]\nand\npromoting conspiracy theories\n.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\nTrump's\npolitical movement\nwas described by several historians and former\nTrump administration\nofficials as\nauthoritarian\n, featuring\nparallels to fascism\n, and using\ndehumanizing\nrhetoric toward his political opponents.\n[\nd\n]\n[\ne\n]\nAccording to polls, the most important issues for voters were\nthe economy\n,\n[\n24\n]\nhealthcare\n,\n[\n25\n]\ndemocracy\n,\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\nforeign policy\n(notably\nU.S. support for Israel\nand\nfor Ukraine\n),\n[\n28\n]\nillegal immigration\n,\n[\n29\n]\n[\n30\n]\nabortion\n,\n[\n31\n]\n[\n32\n]\n[\n33\n]\nand\nclimate change\n.\n[\n34\n]\n[\n35\n]\n[\n36\n]\nEducation\nand\nLGBTQ rights\nwere also prominent issues in the campaign.\n[\n37\n]\n[\n38\n]\nPolled voters consistently cited the economy as being the single most important issue in the election.\n[\n24\n]\n[\n34\n]\nTrump achieved victory in the\nElectoral College\n, winning 312 electoral votes to Harris' 226. Trump won every\nswing state\nin addition to holding on to all of the states that he won in 2020.\n[\n39\n]\n[\n40\n]\n[\n41\n]\nTrump won the national\npopular vote\nwith a plurality of 49.8%,\n[\n42\n]\nmaking him the first Republican to do so since\nGeorge W. Bush\nin\n2004\n,\n[\n43\n]\nand with the third smallest margin of victory since 1888.\n[\n44\n]\nRelative to the 2020 election, he improved his vote share among\nworking class\nvoters, particularly among young men, those without college degrees, and\nHispanic\nvoters.\n[\n45\n]\nThis was the second of two elections won by Trump, the first being in\n2016\nagainst\nHillary Clinton\n, preceding his defeat by Biden in 2020. Trump became the first president since\nGrover Cleveland\nin\n1892\nto be elected to non-consecutive terms.\n[\n46\n]\nBackground\nThe\nincumbent\nin 2024,\nJoe Biden\n. His term expires at noon on January 20, 2025\nA general election absentee ballot, listing the presidential and vice presidential candidates\nProcedure\nMain article:\nUnited States presidential election § Procedure\nArticle Two\nof the\nConstitution of United States\nstates that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\n, be at least 35 years of age, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. The\nTwenty-second Amendment\nforbids any person from being elected president more than twice. Major party candidates seek the nomination through a series of\nprimary elections\nthat select the delegates who choose the candidate at the party's national convention. Each party's national convention chooses a vice presidential\nrunning mate\nto form that party's\nticket\n. The nominee for president usually picks the running mate, who is then ratified by the delegates at the party's convention. If no candidate wins a majority of their party's delegates' votes, or (in this election) a party's presumptive nominee drops out of the race between the primaries and the convention, a\nbrokered convention\nmay be held: the delegates are then \"released\" and are free to switch their allegiance to a different candidate.\n[\n47\n]\nThe general election in November is an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the\nElectoral College\n; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.\n[\n48\n]\nElection offices are dealing with increased workloads and public scrutiny. Officials in many states have sought additional funding to hire more personnel, improve security, and extend training. Numerous election offices are dealing with an increase in retirements and are overwhelmed with\npublic records requests\n, owing in part to the electoral mistrust planted by former President Trump's loss in the 2020 election.\n[\n49\n]\n[\n50\n]\nTrump is the first president in American history to be\nimpeached twice\n, and the first to run again after impeachment. Trump was\nfirst impeached\nby the\nDemocratic\n-controlled House of Representatives in December 2019 for \"\nabuse of power\nand\nobstruction of Congress\n\" due to his\nattempts to pressure\nUkraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son,\nHunter\n, by withholding military aid.\n[\n51\n]\nTrump's second impeachment\nby the House occurred on January 13, 2021, for \"\nincitement of insurrection\n\" owing to his role in the\nJanuary 6 United States Capitol attack\n. As Trump was acquitted by the Senate in both cases, he was not barred from seeking reelection to the presidency in 2024.\n[\n52\n]\nElection interference\nMain article:\nElection interference\nFurther information:\nRepublican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election\n,\nAttempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election\n, and\nJanuary 6 United States Capitol attack\nSeveral state courts and officials, including the\nColorado Supreme Court\n,\n[\n53\n]\na state Circuit Court in\nIllinois\n,\n[\n54\n]\nand the\nSecretary of State of Maine\n,\n[\n55\n]\nruled that\nTrump was ineligible to hold office\nunder Section 3 of the\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\nfor his role in the\nJanuary 6 Capitol attack\n, and thus attempted to disqualify him from appearing on the ballot.\n[\n56\n]\n[\n55\n]\nThese attempts were unsuccessful, and on March 4, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in\nTrump v. Anderson\nthat states cannot determine eligibility for a national election under Section 3, and only Congress has the authority to disqualify candidates, or to pass legislation that allows courts to do so.\n[\n57\n]\nDonald Trump's false claims of interference\nFurther information:\nBig lie § Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election\n,\nElection denial movement in the United States\n, and\nRepublican Party efforts to disrupt the 2024 United States presidential election\nTo sow election doubt, Trump escalated use of \"rigged election\" and \"election interference\" statements in advance of the 2024 election compared to the previous two elections\n[\n58\n]\nTrump made\nfalse claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election\n, and continued denying the election results.\n[\n59\n]\n[\n60\n]\nElection security experts warned that officials who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election may attempt to impede the voting process, or refuse to certify the 2024 results.\n[\n61\n]\nIn July 2024,\nThe New York Times\nreported that \"the Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in an unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting system\", by restricting voting for partisan advantage ahead of Election Day and preparing to mount \"legally dubious\" challenges against the certification process if Trump were to lose.\n[\n62\n]\nIn the lead up to the 2024 election, the Republican Party made false claims of massive \"noncitizen voting\" by immigrants in an attempt to delegitimize the election in the event of a Trump defeat.\n[\n63\n]\n[\n64\n]\n[\n65\n]\nThe claims were made as part of larger Republican Party efforts to disrupt the 2024 election and\nelection denial\nmovement.\n[\n66\n]\nTrump continued spreading his \"big lie\" of a stolen election and predicted without evidence that the 2024 election would be rigged against him. Trump also falsely accused Biden of \"weaponizing\" the Justice Department to target him in relation to\nhis criminal trials\n.\n[\n58\n]\nTrump and several Republicans  stated they would not accept the results of the 2024 election if they believe they are \"unfair\".\n[\n67\n]\nTrump's previous comments suggesting he can \"terminate\" the Constitution to reverse his election loss,\n[\n68\n]\n[\n69\n]\nhis claim that he would only be a dictator on \"day one\" of his presidency and not after,\n[\nf\n]\nhis promise to use the Justice Department to go after his political enemies,\n[\n76\n]\nhis plan to use the\nInsurrection Act of 1807\nto deploy the military for law enforcement in primarily Democratic cities and states,\n[\n77\n]\n[\n78\n]\nattempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election\n, continued\nRepublican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election\n, Trump's baseless predictions of voter fraud in the 2024 election,\n[\n79\n]\nand Trump's public embrace and celebration of the\nJanuary 6 United States Capitol attack\n,\n[\n80\n]\nraised\nconcerns over the state of democracy in the United States\n.\n[\n81\n]\n[\n82\n]\n[\n83\n]\n[\n84\n]\nTrump's political operation said that it planned to deploy more than 100,000 attorneys and volunteers to polling places across battleground states, with an \"election integrity hotline\" for poll watchers and voters to report alleged voting irregularities.\n[\n85\n]\nInterference by foreign nations\nMain article:\nForeign interference in the 2024 United States elections\nBefore the election, U.S. officials and former officials stated that foreign interference in the 2024 election was likely. Three major factors cited were \"America's deepening domestic political crises, the collapse of controversial attempts to control political speech on social media, and the rise of\ngenerative AI\n\".\n[\n86\n]\nChina, Russia, and Iran were identified as mounting influence operations and attempts to interfere with the 2024 election. U.S. intelligence officials described the efforts as part of broader efforts by authoritarian nations to use the internet to erode support for democracy.\n[\n87\n]\nChina\nFurther information:\nChinese interference in the 2024 United States elections\nChina was identified as interfering with the 2024 election through propaganda and disinformation campaigns linked to its\nSpamouflage\noperation. U.S. intelligence agencies described the effort as not targeting any particular candidate but focusing on issues important to the\nChinese government\n, such as Taiwan, and \"undermining confidence in elections, voting, and the U.S. in general\".\n[\n87\n]\nAs early as April 1, 2024,\nThe New York Times\nreported that the Chinese government had created fake pro-Trump accounts on social media \"promoting conspiracy theories, stoking domestic divisions and attacking President Biden ahead of the election in November\".\n[\n88\n]\nRussia\nFurther information:\nRussian interference in the 2024 United States elections\nAccording to disinformation experts and intelligence agencies, Russia spread disinformation ahead of the 2024 election to damage Biden and Democrats, boost candidates supporting isolationism, and undercut support for Ukraine aid and NATO.\n[\n89\n]\n[\n90\n]\nOn September 4, 2024, the United States publicly accused Russia of interfering in the 2024 election and announced several steps to combat Russian influence including\nsanctions\n, indictments, and seizing of web domains used to spread propaganda and disinformation. U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Russia preferred Trump to win the election, viewing him as more critical of American support for Ukraine.\n[\n91\n]\nIran\nFurther information:\nIranian interference in the 2024 United States elections\nIran was identified as interfering with the 2024 presidential election through front companies connected to the\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\nand hacking attempts against the Trump, Biden, and Harris campaigns starting as early as May 2024.\n[\n92\n]\nIran launched propaganda and disinformation campaigns through fake news websites and accounts on social media to tip the election against former president Trump.\nThe New York Times\nstated the efforts were an attempt at \"sowing internal discord and discrediting the democratic system in the United States more broadly in the eyes of the world\".\n[\n92\n]\n[\n93\n]\n[\n94\n]\nVoter roll purges\nFurther information:\nRepublican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election\nMultiple Republican-led administrations removed voters from their state's voter rolls in the lead up to the election, which critics argued violates the\nNational Voter Registration Act\n.\n[\n95\n]\n[\n96\n]\n[\n97\n]\nIn July 2024, 160,000 inactive or infrequent voters were removed from\nOhio\n's voter rolls.\n[\n98\n]\n[\n99\n]\nThe Ohio chapters of\nCommon Cause\nand the\nLeague of Women Voters\nthreatened lawsuits against the state over the purge.\n[\n100\n]\n[\n101\n]\nIn August 2024, Governor\nGlenn Youngkin\nof\nVirginia\nsigned an executive order removing 6,303 voters suspected of being non-citizens from Virginia's voter rolls.\n[\n102\n]\n[\n103\n]\nIn October 2024, the\nU.S. Department of Justice\nsued the Virginia Board of Elections and Virginia commissioner of elections over the voter purge, alleging that it violated the\nNational Voter Registration Act\n.\n[\n104\n]\n[\n105\n]\nThe suit also found a number of alleged non-citizens purged were actually citizens.\n[\n105\n]\n[\n106\n]\nDistrict judge\nPatricia Tolliver Giles\nruled that the removal was illegal, ordering the state to stop purging voter rolls and to restore the voter registration of more than 1,600 voters who had been removed.\n[\n107\n]\n[\n106\n]\nThe\n4th Circuit Court of Appeals\nthen upheld the order.\n[\n108\n]\n[\n109\n]\nThe administration filed an emergency appeal to the\nU.S. Supreme Court\n, which sided with Virginia in a 6–3 decision\nalong ideological lines\n, allowing the state to continue purging voter rolls.\n[\n109\n]\n[\n110\n]\nIn August 2024,\nAlabama\nSecretary of State\nWes Allen\nannounced a process for purging 3,251 registered Alabama voters and referred them to the state attorney general's office for criminal prosecution.\n[\n96\n]\n[\n111\n]\nIn September 2024, the Department of Justice sued Alabama for violating the National Voter Registration Act.\n[\n112\n]\n[\n113\n]\nIn October 2024, district judge\nAnna Manasco\nruled in favor of the Department of Justice, ordering the state to restore the voter registrations.\n[\n114\n]\n[\n115\n]\nAlabama secretary of state's chief of staff Clay Helms testified that 2,000 of the purged voters were legally registered citizens.\n[\n115\n]\nCriminal trials and indictments against Donald Trump\nMain article:\nIndictments against Donald Trump\nFurther information:\nFederal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case)\n,\nGeorgia election racketeering prosecution\n,\nFederal prosecution of Donald Trump (classified documents case)\n,\nProsecution of Donald Trump in New York\n, and\nPersonal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump\nTrump was found liable in civil proceedings for both\nsexual abuse\nand\ndefamation\nin 2023 and defamation in 2024, while also being criminally convicted of 34\nfelonies\nrelated to\nfalsifying business records\n, expected to be an issue during the campaign. As of December 2023, he had four criminal\nindictments\ntotaling 86 felony counts and there are other lawsuits against Trump.\n[\n116\n]\nOn May 30, 2024, Trump was found guilty by a jury of all 34 felony counts in\nThe People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump\nover falsifying business records for\nhush money\npayments to pornographic film star\nStormy Daniels\n, to ensure her silence about\na sexual encounter between them\n, to influence the 2016 presidential election. This made Trump the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime in American history.\n[\n117\n]\nTrump and many Republicans have made numerous false and misleading statements regarding Trump's criminal trials, including false claims that they are \"rigged\" or \"election interference\" orchestrated by Biden and the Democratic Party, of which there is no evidence.\n[\n118\n]\n[\n58\n]\nClassified intelligence material found inside\nMar-a-Lago\nin 2022\nTrump faces an additional 52 felony counts: 4 counts in\nUnited States of America v.

Roosevelt\n, and\nRichard Nixon\n. Nixon and Trump are the only presidential candidates to win a significant number of electoral votes in three presidential elections since term limits were enacted with the ratification of the\nTwenty-second Amendment\n; Trump is the only one of those eight that won the popular vote exactly once (Clay and Bryan never won it). Trump is also the first president since Cleveland in 1892 to win non-consecutive terms, and the only president to win non-consecutive terms since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment, as well as the first Republican to do so.\n[\n46\n]\nTrump is the first Republican since\nGeorge W. Bush\nin 2004 to win the popular vote, the same year a Republican last secured a second term. Trump is the first non-incumbent Republican to have won the popular vote since\nGeorge H. W. Bush\nin 1988.\n[\n43\n]\n[\n649\n]\nTrump improved his percentage of the vote in every state and DC compared to the 2020 election; 2024 was the first presidential election since\n1976\nin which all 50 states and DC shifted to the same party.\n[\n650\n]\n[\n651\n]\nTrump numerically performed with 49.8% of the vote, one of the smallest margins of victory since 1888, with his 1.48%\n[\n42\n]\n[\n652\n]\nvictory smaller than every winning president other than two: John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Richard Nixon in 1968.\n[\n44\n]\nWhile winning the popular vote, Trump did not win a majority of the popular vote, with his final tally roughly a half-percent smaller than Hillary Clinton's national popular-vote margin over Trump in 2016. Thus, Trump is the first Republican since Nixon in 1968 to win the popular vote with a plurality.\n[\n652\n]\nThis was the first election since\n1944\nin which a presidential candidate won two elections with a different vice presidential candidate, as Trump replaced\nMike Pence\nwith\nJD Vance\n. This was the third election in which the losing party failed to flip any states from the previous election, in 2012 Romney was able to flip Indiana and North Carolina despite losing. It was also the fifth election in a row in which only one party flipped states; the last time both parties flipped states was in 2004 when Kerry flipped New Hampshire, while Bush flipped Iowa and New Mexico.\nAround 90% of counties swung towards Trump between the 2020 and 2024 elections, encompassing both rural and urban areas,\n[\n653\n]\nand it was the first time since\n1932\nin which the losing candidate failed to flip a single county.\n[\n654\n]\nAll 50 states and D.C. swung towards Trump from 2020, making this the first time that they swung in the same direction since\n1976\n.\n[\n655\n]\nWhile most suburban areas also swung towards Trump, notable exceptions included those with large numbers of white college-educated voters, such as the suburbs of\nAtlanta\n,\nIndianapolis\n, and\nMilwaukee\n. Trump made substantial gains among Hispanic voters, most notably in\nSouth Florida\nand the\nRio Grande Valley\n. Even among states that voted heavily for Biden in the 2020 election, Trump's gains were significant. The states of\nNew York\nand\nNew Jersey\nswung over ten points toward Trump, and Trump also gained in Harris' home state of\nCalifornia\n.\n[\n656\n]\nWhile there had been significant speculation prior to the election of Trump increasing his support among black voters, particularly black men,\n[\n657\n]\nexit polling data showed only a marginal increase in black support for Trump (from 12% to 13%). Trump's gain was limited by the fact he lost ground among black women, only garnering 7% of their vote,\n[\n658\n]\ncompared to 9% in 2020.\n[\n659\n]\nWhile Trump made gains among young voters compared to Republicans in recent presidential elections, especially among young men,\n[\n45\n]\nexit polls found Harris still won young voters by 51 to 54 percent of voters under 30, leading Trump by 4 to 12 points.\n[\n660\n]\nDemocrats performed better in the downballot races,\n[\n661\n]\n[\n662\n]\nwhere they kept Republican margins extremely narrow in the House of Representatives and won Senate elections in\nArizona\n,\nMichigan\n,\nNevada\n, and\nWisconsin\ndespite Trump carrying those states.\n[\n663\n]\n[\n664\n]\nPost-election research by the\nBrookings Institution\nfound that while Trump made inroads with minority voters, the Republican Party had \"hardly\" created a multiracial coalition, arguing that saying so was premature and that such support \"could very well be a blip\" based more on economic concerns.\n[\n665\n]\nDecline in Democratic turnout also was a major contributor to Trump winning the popular vote. Comparisons to 2020 and 2024 votes cast in heavily populated Democratic urban centers showed Harris losing millions of votes. New York City cast 573,000 fewer votes for Harris than Biden, Miami-Dade County 137,000, Cook County 295,000, Los Angeles County 620,000, and Harris County 115,000. Statewide, the only states that Harris received more votes than Biden were Maine, Utah, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia and Wisconsin. Harris lost votes in critical battlegrounds Pennsylvania, Arizona and Michigan. Trump managed to gain another 2.5 million votes, mostly coming out of urban centers, but still garnering a couple hundred to thousands in rural and\nexurban\ncounties across the Midwest, Northeast, Southeast and\nMountain\nregions.\n[\n666\n]\nHarris won 226 Electoral College votes, the worst performance for a Democratic presidential ticket since that of\nMichael Dukakis\nin\n1988\n. Trump won 312 electoral college votes, carrying 31 of 50 states.\n[\n667\n]\nBy winning, Trump, aged 78, is the\noldest person\never to be elected U.S. president;\n[\n668\n]\nVance, aged 40, is the first\nMillennial\nto be elected vice president.\n[\n669\n]\nIn addition, this was the most recent of two elections in the 21st century in which a candidate from either party won fewer than 20 states, with the other being\n2004\n, where\nJohn Kerry\nalso won only 19 states.\nVoter demographics\nExit poll\n2024 presidential election exit poll\n[\n496\n]\nhide\nDemographic subgroup\nTrump\nHarris\n% of\ntotal vote\nIdeology\nLiberals\n7\n91\n23\nModerates\n40\n58\n42\nConservatives\n90\n9\n35\nParty\nDemocrats\n4\n95\n31\nRepublicans\n94\n5\n35\nIndependents\n46\n49\n34\nGender\nMen\n55\n43\n47\nWomen\n45\n53\n53\nMarital status\nMarried\n56\n42\n54\nUnmarried\n42\n55\n46\nGender by marital status\nMarried men\n60\n38\n28\nMarried women\n52\n47\n26\nUnmarried men\n48\n48\n19\nUnmarried women\n38\n61\n26\nRace/ethnicity\nWhite\n57\n42\n71\nBlack\n13\n86\n11\nLatino\n46\n51\n11\nAsian\n40\n55\n3\nNative American/American Indian\n68\n31\n1\nOther\n52\n44\n2\nGender by race/ethnicity\nWhite men\n60\n38\n34\nWhite women\n53\n46\n37\nBlack men\n21\n77\n5\nBlack women\n7\n92\n7\nLatino men\n54\n44\n6\nLatina women\n39\n58\n6\nOther\n47\n49\n6\nReligion\nProtestant\n/Other\nChristian\n63\n36\n43\nCatholic\n59\n39\n21\nJewish\n22\n78\n2\nOther religion\n34\n61\n10\nNo religious affiliation\n27\n71\n24\nReligion by race\nWhite Protestant\n72\n26\n31\nWhite Catholic\n63\n35\n15\nWhite Jewish\n20\n79\n2\nWhite other religion\n42\n55\n5\nWhite no religious affiliation\n26\n71\n17\nWhite evangelical or born again Christian\nYes\n82\n17\n23\nNo\n40\n58\n77\nAge\n18–24 years old\n43\n54\n8\n25–29 years old\n45\n53\n5\n30–39 years old\n45\n51\n15\n40–49 years old\n49\n49\n15\n50–64 years old\n56\n43\n27\n65 and older\n50\n49\n28\nAge by gender\nMen 18–29 years old\n49\n48\n7\nMen 30–44 years old\n52\n45\n11\nMen 45–64 years old\n59\n39\n16\nMen 65 and older\n56\n43\n12\nWomen 18–29 years old\n38\n61\n7\nWomen 30–44 years old\n41\n56\n12\nWomen 45–64 years old\n50\n49\n19\nWomen 65 years and older\n46\n53\n16\nAge by race\nWhite 18–29 years old\n49\n49\n8\nWhite 30–44 years old\n54\n44\n15\nWhite 45–64 years old\n61\n37\n25\nWhite 65 and older\n56\n43\n23\nBlack 18–29 years old\n16\n83\n2\nBlack 30–44 years old\n15\n83\n3\nBlack 45–64 years old\n14\n84\n4\nBlack 65 and older\n6\n93\n3\nLatino 18–29 years old\n45\n51\n2\nLatino 30–44 years old\n45\n52\n3\nLatino 45–64 years old\n48\n51\n4\nLatino 65 and older\n41\n58\n2\nOthers\n47\n49\n6\nSexual orientation\nLGBT\n12\n86\n8\nNon-LGBT\n53\n45\n92\nFirst time voter\nYes\n55\n44\n8\nNo\n49\n49\n92\nEducation\nHigh school or less\n62\n36\n15\nSome college education\n51\n47\n26\nAssociate degree\n57\n41\n16\nBachelor's degree\n45\n53\n24\nPostgraduate degree\n38\n59\n19\nEducation by race\nWhite college graduates\n45\n53\n33\nWhite no college degree\n66\n32\n38\nNon-White college graduates\n32\n65\n10\nNon-White no college degree\n34\n64\n18\nEducation by race/gender\nWhite women with college degrees\n41\n58\n17\nWhite women without college degrees\n63\n35\n20\nWhite men with college degrees\n50\n48\n16\nWhite men without college degrees\n69\n29\n18\nNon-White\n33\n64\n29\nIncome\nUnder $30,000\n46\n50\n11\n$30,000–49,999\n52\n46\n16\n$50,000–99,999\n52\n46\n32\n$100,000–199,999\n46\n51\n28\nOver $200,000\n46\n52\n13\nUnion households\nYes\n45\n53\n19\nNo\n51\n47\n81\nMilitary service\nVeterans\n65\n34\n13\nNon-veterans\n48\n50\n87\nRegion\nEast\n44\n54\n20\nMidwest\n52\n46\n22\nSouth\n56\n43\n35\nWest\n43\n54\n22\nArea type\nUrban\n38\n60\n29\nSuburban\n51\n47\n52\nRural\n64\n34\n19\nWhite suburban voters by gender\nWhite suburban women\n53\n46\n20\nWhite suburban men\n62\n36\n18\nOther voters\n45\n52\n62\nPolling accuracy\nAfter the 2020 misses, pollsters took steps to avoid similar errors.\n[\n670\n]\n[\n671\n]\nDespite this, national polls underestimated Trump a third time,\n[\n672\n]\nalbeit by less than in 2016 and 2020,\n[\n673\n]\nand within the realm of a\nnormal polling error\n;\n[\n674\n]\n[\n675\n]\nmost polls going into the election showed essentially a tie, \"within the poll's margin of error\",\n[\n676\n]\nand thus both Harris and Trump were a normal polling error away from the win, although this did not preclude either Harris or Trump achieving a sweep of the battleground states.\n[\n677\n]\n[\n678\n]\nIn every swing state, Trump outperformed his final polling numbers by around 3%, which is in line with a normal margin of error.\n[\n679\n]\nIn 2016, the national polls were fairly accurate but Trump overperforming the polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin led to his Electoral College victory. In 2020, polls overestimated Biden's margin over Trump by about 4% in competitive states.\n[\n680\n]\nIn 2024, compared to 2020, the margin of error in swing states was less, and high-quality national polls were more accurate.\n[\n675\n]\nThere was also much discussion about the Electoral College bias, and the margin Harris had to achieve over Trump nationally to win in the Electoral College, which was lower than in 2020;\n[\n681\n]\n[\n682\n]\nin 2016 and 2020, the Electoral College bias in favor of Republicans was 2.9% and 3.8%, and according to late September 2024 polls it had been reduced to 0.7%,\n[\n683\n]\nwith the unlikely but not impossible outcome of Harris losing the national vote but winning the Electoral College.\n[\n684\n]\nAs polling generally does not underestimate a party three cycles in a row, several pundits and media outlets had suggested that Harris was being underestimated by polls,\n[\n685\n]\nand discussed the possibility of \"shy Harris voters\",\n[\n686\n]\n[\n687\n]\n[\n688\n]\nreferencing the\nshy Tory factor\n.\n[\n689\n]\nThe results of the\n2022 midterms\nhad also lent more legitimacy to this theory as predictions of a\nred wave election\nhad evaporated on election day, with some accusing Republicans of \"flooding the zone\" with pollsters biased in their favor,\n[\n690\n]\nalthough this did not seem to affect\npolling aggregators\n.\n[\n691\n]\n[\n692\n]\nPolling averages were more accurate in swing states but vastly underestimated Trump's strength in both safe red and blue states,\n[\n674\n]\nwhich helped to reduce the Electoral College bias.\n[\n693\n]\nFlorida and Texas were both projected to go for Trump by about 7%; he won them by about 13%.\n[\n674\n]\nPollster\nAnn Selzer\nreleased a poll in Iowa that had Harris winning the state by 3%,\n[\n694\n]\nonly for Trump to take the state by 13%.\n[\n674\n]\nOn the other hand, New Jersey was projected to be a safe state for Harris but most news stations waited until 90% of the vote was in before calling it for Harris, as she was only leading by 5%.\n[\n695\n]\n[\n696\n]\nHistorian\nAllan Lichtman\nincorrectly predicted a Harris win using\nThe Keys to the White House\nsystem.\n[\n697\n]\nAftermath\nElection night\nDuration: 2 minutes and 53 seconds.\n2:53\nA\nVoice of America\nreport on Trump's victory\nMCC-CFR Election Night with\nPeter Boghossian\n,\nGladden Pappin\n, and Miklós Szánthó\nNewsNation\nwas the first TV network to call the race for Trump; the network relied on data from\nDecision Desk HQ\n, and the projection was made at 1:22\na.m. EST on November 6.\n[\n698\n]\nNewsmax\n, which also used Decision Desk HQ, quickly followed in calling the election for Trump.\nFox News\nprojected Trump as the winner at 1:47\na.m., while ABC, the\nAssociated Press\n, CBS, CNN, and NBC all called the race around 5\na.m.\n[\n699\n]\nIn a convention center in\nWest Palm Beach, Florida\n, he was greeted with cheers by supporters, chanting, \"\nUSA! USA! USA!\n\" when Fox News declared him the winner. Trump claimed victory in a speech to his supporters, where he was joined on stage by his family and his running mate,\nJD Vance\n, saying: \"America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.\" Harris did not speak to her supporters, who had gathered at\nHoward University\n, her\nalma mater\n. Her campaign co-chair,\nCedric Richmond\n, briefly addressed the crowd, saying Harris would speak publicly on Wednesday.\n[\n700\n]\nA few hours later, other media outlets also projected Trump as the 47th president of the United States, with the Associated Press describing it as an \"extraordinary comeback for a former president\".\n[\n8\n]\nReactions\nCrisis services for the LGBTQ+ community saw a sharp increase in usage during the election week.\nThe Trevor Project\n's crisis lines saw a 125% increase since around midnight on election night according to a statement by CEO Jaymes Black on November 6, and followed an about 200% increase in election related conversations that had been seen between November 3–4. By November 8, it was reported that the organization saw an overall increase by 700%. The\nCrisis Text Line\nalso reported that 56% of their users reported as LGBTQ+ on election day.\n[\n701\n]\n[\n702\n]\nGoogle search trends after Trump was announced as the winner also saw spikes in specific searches, with the term \"tariff\" and \"Trump's tariff plan\" showing an increase by 1,650% since the election. A similar search of \"who pays tariffs\" saw an increase of 350%.\n[\n703\n]\nOther google search trend spikes were seen with \"How to change my vote\" spiking the morning of November 5 specifically in Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska and Alabama.\n[\n704\n]\nMoving to other countries from the United States also saw a surge in searches after the election with an overall 1,514% increase in Google searches overall. The highest increase was seen in searches about moving to New Zealand, Germany, and the Netherlands, which respectively saw increases of 7,600%, 4,200%, and 3,233%.\n[\n705\n]\nA company that assists wealthy Americans in securing foreign citizenship saw a 200× jump in inquiries.\n[\n706\n]\nPolitical\nHarris conceded victory to Trump on November 6\nDemocrats had split reactions to the loss, with differing views on why Harris lost the election. Vermont Senator\nBernie Sanders\ncriticized the Democratic campaign afterward, saying the party \"abandoned\nworking class\npeople\" and found that \"the working class has abandoned them\". He further blamed \"big money\" and \"well-paid\nconsultants\n\" for the loss, and argued against sending billions of dollars in military aid to Israel.\n[\n707\n]\nWhile expressing respect for Sanders and his views, former House speaker\nNancy Pelosi\ndisagreed with the claim that the \"Democratic Party has abandoned the working-class families\", instead blaming the party's loss on Biden's late exit and the lack of an open Democratic primary.\nThe New York Times\nreported Pelosi felt cultural issues were more to blame for the party's losses among working-class voters.\n[\n708\n]\nDemocratic National Committee\nchair\nJaime Harrison\ndismissed Sanders' criticism as \"straight-up BS\".\n[\n709\n]\n[\n710\n]\nSanders also wrote an article in\nThe Boston Globe\n, in which he offered a list of \"working class priorities\" that Democrats should fight for. In it, he acknowledged some positive changes achieved by Biden but said that they were \"almost never discussed within the context of a grossly unfair economy that continues to fail ordinary Americans\" and did not address the anger of the working class.\n[\n711\n]\nSenator\nChris Murphy\n(D-CT) believed that the Democrats couldn't connect to a large amount of voters, and should embrace\npopulism\ngoing forward.\n[\n712\n]\n[\n713\n]\nRepresentative\nRitchie Torres\n(D-NY), who represents\nthe Bronx\n, said he wasn't surprised by Harris' loss. Torres attributed Trump's victory to public discontent over inflation and immigration, and believed that Harris ran an effective campaign, but could not overcome the difficult electoral environment.\n[\n714\n]\nPresident\nJoe Biden\n(right) and President-elect\nDonald Trump\n(left) meet in the\nOval Office\nof the\nWhite House\nas part of the presidential transition.\nRepresentative\nLloyd Doggett\n, who was the first sitting Democrat in Congress to openly call for President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential election after the first presidential debate, stated, \"I only regret I didn't do it earlier. I think it's unfortunate that he took three weeks to decide. I believe that the only person in our caucus who doesn't share some responsibility for the outcome is\nDean Phillips\n, who came out early. I accept responsibility as well that there's more that we could have done.\"\n[\n715\n]\nFormer Republican president\nGeorge W. Bush\n, who had declined to endorse either candidate, offered his congratulations to Trump and said that what he defined as a \"strong turnout\" in the election was a \"sign of the health of our republic and the strength of our democratic institutions\".\n[\n716\n]\nFormer president\nBarack Obama\nand his wife\nMichelle\nreleased a statement admitting their \"profound disagreements with the Republican ticket on a whole host of issues\", and lauded Harris and Walz's efforts yet emphasized \"recognizing that our point of view won't always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power\" concerning the incoming Trump administration.\n[\n717\n]\nOn November 6, the day after Trump's victory, Harris publicly conceded her loss.\n[\n718\n]\nInternational reactions\nSeveral reactions from governments, individuals, organizations, and multi-nation institutions around the world emerged for the re-election of Trump with, generally, most world governments congratulating Trump on his victory in the election.\nFinancial\nWall Street's main indexes reported record highs on the day after election night, with the\nDow Jones Industrial Average\nup 3.57%, the\nS&P 500\nup 2.53%, and\nNasdaq\nup 2.95%.\n[\n719\n]\nElon Musk\n, a prominent Trump supporter and the CEO of\nTesla\n, saw a nearly $20 billion increase in his fortune following a post-election surge in the company's stock by 12% to a high of $288 per share.\n[\n720\n]\nOn the Friday after, November 8, Tesla's shares surged more than 6%, bringing the company's market cap to $1 trillion.\n[\n721\n]\nIts growth started from $807.1 billion through Tuesday's close, rallying a total of 27% during election week. By Friday, the stock was up about 26% year to date.\n[\n721\n]\n\"Stolen election\" conspiracy theories\nFollowing Trump's victory, some Harris supporters on\nX\nshared\nelection denial\nconspiracy theories, claiming that millions of ballots were \"left uncounted\" and there being something \"not right\" with the election. Such posts falsely claiming Trump \"stole\" the election peaked at noon the day after at 94,000 posts per hour, with many receiving amplification and gaining over a million views each. According to\nGordon Crovitz\n, the CEO of the media rating system\nNewsGuard\n, the phrase \"Trump cheated\" received 92,100 mentions on the platform from midnight until the Wednesday morning after.\n[\n722\n]\nBesides the claims from Harris' supporters, some Trump supporters baselessly claimed the disparity between other years, the 2020 election, and a then-incomplete 2024 voting total indicated voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n[\n723\n]\n[\n724\n]\nOne major \"basis\" these false claims were founded upon was a claim that Biden won 20 million more votes in his prior election bid than Harris had in hers, at the time.\n[\n723\n]\n[\n724\n]\nAmerican journalist and conspiracy theorist\nWayne Madsen\ncommented on\nThreads\n: \"I'm beginning to believe our election was\nmassively hacked just like happened a few weeks ago in the Republic of Georgia\n.\"\n[\n725\n]\nAt the time these fallacies were disseminated, votes were still being counted in many states.\n[\n722\n]\n[\n726\n]\nAn estimate around the time using the Associated Press vote percentage total found that 16.2 million votes across twenty states and D.C. had yet to be counted. Statistical analysis of voting asserted that despite continued counting, the projections were already set and new ballots would not sway the outcomes of any of the states and D.C.\n[\n726\n]\nThe\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\ndirector\nJen Easterly\nrefuted the false claims, and wrote in a statement that there was \"no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure\".\n[\n722\n]\n[\n725\n]\nAnother false claim alleges Musk used the satellite internet constellation\nStarlink\nto change the results of the election.\nChief technology officer\nChip Trowbridge of voting system manufacturer Clear Ballot dismissed the claim and added no machine used to scan voting ballots have any network connection whatsoever.\n[\n727\n]\nText message harassment\nNumerous Black Americans across multiple states reported receiving\nthreatening, racist text messages\nthe day after the election. Some of the texts referenced the incoming Trump administration but the sender remained unknown as of November 10, 2024.\n[\n728\n]\nDays later, several Hispanic and LGBTQIA students also reported receiving similar harassment through text message and email.\n[\n729\n]\nMedia analysis\nHarris' loss\nHarris' loss to Trump received substantial media analysis, ranging from the years of inflation and an earlier\nimmigration crisis\n, to global incumbency backlash, to Biden's too late exit and the lack of an open primary, with Democrats and others arguing about what went wrong and how should the party move forward.\n[\n730\n]\n[\n731\n]\nElectoral environment\nAccording to exit polls, voters disapproved of Biden's performance 59-39%, and disapproved of how things were going in the United States 73-25%. Also, voters judged the economy negatively 68-32%,\n[\n732\n]\nand said that inflation had caused them hardship 75-24%.\n[\n496\n]\nA\nYouGov\npoll conducted from November 6–7, 2024 found that if Biden had been the Democratic nominee, Trump would have won the popular vote 49-42%.\n[\n733\n]\nNonpartisan election forecasters, including\nThe Cook Political Report\nand\nSabato's Crystal Ball\n, stated before the election that Biden was almost certain to lose if he had been the Democratic nominee.\n[\n734\n]\n[\n735\n]\nAlmost every incumbent party worldwide facing election in 2024 lost vote share, including in\nSouth Africa\n,\nIndia\n,\nFrance\n, the\nUnited Kingdom\n, and\nJapan\n.\n[\n736\n]\n[\n737\n]\nAmong democracies, over 80 percent saw the incumbent party lose support compared to the last election.\n[\n738\n]\nThis is the first time this has ever happened since 1905 (when data was first recorded) and the first time in the\nhistory of democracy\n, as\nuniversal suffrage\nbegan in 1894.\n[\n739\n]\nAll 50 states and the District of Columbia shifted rightward compared to 2020. Trump's gains in nearly all geographic areas and among nearly every demographic group provides strong evidence of anti-incumbent backlash.\n[\n740\n]\n[\n741\n]\nThe shifts toward Trump were much less in the swing states where both campaigns focused compared to safe states. The two states with the largest shifts toward Trump, New York and New Jersey, were both won by Harris.\n[\n742\n]\nStatistician and election analyst\nNate Silver\nargued beforehand that the national electoral environment was difficult for Democrats to begin with.\n[\n743\n]\nAfter the election, Silver felt that Harris was a\nreplacement-level\ncandidate who did much better than Biden would have, but was unable to separate herself from Biden's record and was negatively perceived by swing voters due to her previous  positions.\n[\n744\n]\nAfter the election, Silver believed Biden would have lost the popular vote by 6 to 8 points, likely losing New Hampshire, Minnesota, Virginia, New Mexico, Nebraska's 2nd congressional district, and possibly even New Jersey.\n[\n744\n]\nSilver's final forecast gave the advantage (i.e. greater than 50% odds of winning) to the eventual winner in 48 out of the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and all congressional districts awarding electoral votes. Only Trump's victories in Michigan and Wisconsin did not occur in the majority of Silver's final simulations.\n[\n745\n]\nAmy Walter\n, editor of the nonpartisan\nThe Cook Political Report\n, also argued that the electoral environment was inherently difficult for Harris, because the top issue for voters was inflation during the Biden-Harris administration, for which Trump was viewed more favorably.\n[\n746\n]\nRonald Brownstein\nof\nThe Atlantic\n, who spoke with members of\nHarris' campaign\n, argued that the extent of Biden's unpopularity and public discontent with the economy proved too much for Harris to overcome. Brownstein compared the election to similar past elections, including the\n1968 election\n, when the unpopular incumbent\nLyndon B. Johnson withdrew\nand Vice President\nHubert Humphrey\nlost to\nRichard Nixon\n, and the\n1980 presidential election\n, when incumbent\nJimmy Carter\nlost to\nRonald Reagan\ndue to\nstagflation\nand the\n1970s energy crisis\n. Members of Harris' campaign stated after the election that their internal polling showed Harris either behind or tied with Trump, and they did not believe that Harris was the favorite to win the election.\n[\n747\n]\nAnalyst assessments\nBar plot of the percentage of the population with a Bachelor's degree in the electoral jurisdictions won by Harris in the election\n[\n748\n]\nThe Independent\n'\ns\nJon Sopel\nwrote that the most pressing issues that decided Harris' defeat were matters Biden had been perceived as a failure at by the American public; these included the fact that, as part of the global\n2021–2023 inflation surge\n, inflation went up by 20% and\nreal wages\nhad not adjusted to match, and the state of the\nMexico–United States border\n. Sopel said that by \"embracing the Biden agenda, [Harris] was simply tying herself to his unpopularity\".\n[\n749\n]\nIn a\nTime\npiece, Henry M. J. Tonks tied the result to the party's prioritization of\nprofessional class\nworkers and suburbs over working class,\nblue-collar\nvoters. He argued the shift away from working-class voters had been occurring since the late 1960s in response to the\nVietnam War\nand the growth of the\ntech industry\n.\n[\n750\n]\nOf the electoral jurisdictions that Harris won, 19 states, DC, and Nebraska's second congressional district, all except New Mexico had above-average educational attainment.\n[\n751\n]\nCNN\n's Edward-Isaac Dovere felt that some problems, such as the problems with her staff, could have been solved, but other problems such as her ties with Biden could not have been solved. Dovere mused that had Biden stepped down earlier, the Democratic Party might have had the time to launch a proper primary campaign. He also mused that Walz was chosen because he could not \"outshine\" her, and that this reflected her \"newfound confidence and her long-standing insecurity\".\n[\n752\n]\nThe Economic Times\ncited surveys showing \"broad negative sentiment\" about the economy, and Harris being \"relentlessly hammered\" by Trump during campaigns about this.\nThe Economic Times\ncited\nUniversity of Richmond School of Law\nprofessor Carl Tobias's appraisal of Trump's stance on immigration winning over Harris', and mentioned how Trump had increased his support from Hispanics, especially near the Mexican–American border and in areas impacted by recent immigration.\n[\n753\n]\nHarris campaigning at multiple events with former Republican representative\nLiz Cheney\nhas been suggested as a contributing factor as to why she lost.\n[\n754\n]\n[\n755\n]\n[\n756\n]\nLos Angeles Times\n'\ns Noah Bierman felt Harris could not overcome being the \"turn the page\" candidate, and cited former president\nBarack Obama\n's lead strategist\nDavid Axelrod\n, who said: \"If you're the vice president of an administration people want to fire, you're way behind the eight-ball to start.\" Bierman wrote that besides criminal context, Trump \"never followed a script, scoffed at the rules and spoke directly to the economic and cultural anxieties of the country\".\n[\n757\n]\nIn\nThe New York Times\n, Timothy Shenk argued that Democrats failed to articulate a vision for the future other than being against Trump and did not lean into a message of\neconomic populism\nthat polled best with swing voters but also that the election looked more like a rejection of Biden than the embrace of Trump.\n[\n758\n]\nIn another\nThe New York Times\narticle,\nNate Cohn\nanalyzed exit polls showing Trump's gains among Non-White and young voters, suggesting Trump's populist message resonated with many voters previously considered part of the Democratic Party's base.\n[\n759\n]\nJen Psaki\n, who served as Biden's first\npress secretary\n, suggested that Harris focusing on\nAnti-Trump Republicans\nwas not a winning strategy.\n[\n760\n]\nCharlie Cook, founder of the nonpartisan\nThe Cook Political Report\n, said that swing voters broke in favor of Trump due to anger over inflation associated with the Biden-Harris administration, causing Trump to sweep the swing states. However, Democrats did better in down-ballot races, meaning Trump did not have a strong\ncoattail effect\n.\n[\n761\n]\nThe Atlantic\n'\ns\nRonald Brownstein\nargued that the Democratic Party's success in the\n2022 midterm elections\n, when Trump was not on the ballot, had led them to underestimate Trump's support. Democrats also performed better than Harris in down-ballot races, suggesting voters likely assigned their blame over the economy on the Biden-Harris administration rather than the Democratic Party at-large.\n[\n762\n]\nThe\nBBC\n's Courtney Subramanian said Harris \"couldn't shake the anti-Biden sentiment that permeated much of the electorate\", that she \"failed to deliver a convincing argument about why she should lead the country\", did not state a strategy to combat economic frustrations, and failed to address widespread concerns over immigration.\n[\n763\n]\nVox\n'\ns Nicole Narea highlighted inflation outpacing wages in certain industries, rising\nunemployment\n, and rising\nconsumer debt\nand falling savings as key economic indicators that Democrats \"may have missed\".\n[\n764\n]\nIn another\nVox\narticle, Andrew Prokop argued Harris suffered from a worldwide backlash to incumbents over inflation, as well as her struggles unifying the party over Gaza, failing to be a change candidate, and her difficulty in defending or abandoning positions she took during her\n2020 presidential run\n.\n[\n765\n]\nShe suspended her campaign in December 2019, never giving her the experience of running in a nationwide election as a candidate.\n[\n766\n]\nTrump's victory\nAlthough the economy had recovered by many conventional metrics, wages increased, and inflation was in check, and border crossings had also declined significantly, Trump was ultimately able to successfully convince voters through his promises of fixing the economy and block the flow of immigrants at the border.\n[\n39\n]\nAccording to exit polls, voters whose top issues were the economy and immigration largely voted for Trump.\n[\n732\n]\nAccording to exit polls, Trump won voters making between $30,000 and $100,000, while Harris won voters making less than $30,000 or more than $100,000, though the margins among all income groups were in the single digits.\n[\n496\n]\nTime\n'\ns Eric Cortellessa wrote that the thesis of Trump's campaign boiled down to the simple slogan \"Max out the men and hold the women\", meaning emphasizing the economy and immigration, which Trump did \"relentlessly\". Cortellessa also mentioned Trump's minimization of his numerous controversies, and push-offs of criminal trials via \"a combination of friendly judges and legal postponements\" to after the election. He said Trump's \"advanced age and increasingly incoherent trail rhetoric\" were taken by voters in stride, and that \"much of the country read Trump's legal woes as part of a larger corrupt conspiracy to deny him, and them, power\".\n[\n767\n]\nNPR\nwrote that \"Americans have continued to chafe at higher than pre-pandemic prices and the lack of affordable housing\", and that much of the voter placed the blame \"squarely\" on the Biden administration. NPR said demographics played an important role, with\nWhite\nvoters going up as a share of the electorate from 67% to 71% and Trump winning 46% of\nLatinos\n, and mentioned polling's \"continued underestimation of Trump's support nationally and in the key swing states\".\n[\n768\n]\nThe New York Times\nheadlined how \"[Trump] made one essential bet: that his grievances would become the\ngrievances\nof the MAGA movement, and then the G.O.P., and then more than half the country. It paid off.\"\nThe New York Times\nsaid that Trump's several setbacks actually benefited\nhis public image\nand approval, as \"\nhis mug shot\nbecame a best-selling shirt. His criminal conviction inspired $100 million in donations in one day. The\nimages of him bleeding\nafter a failed assassination attempt became the symbol of what supporters saw as a campaign of destiny.\"\n[\n769\n]\nNBC\ncited a Democratic strategist's appraisal of many men's concerns over feeling like \"they're being left behind, that society doesn't have a place for them\", and that this was a major factor in that demographic's role to return Trump to power. The network said his approval among non-college-educated and middle-income voters, Latinos generally and Latino men specifically, made strides in his promise to assemble a multiracial working-class coalition of supporters.\n[\n770\n]\nTrump increased his support from Hispanics, especially near the Mexican–American border and in areas impacted by recent immigration.\n[\n753\n]\nSeveral observers pointed to shifting habits in how Americans consume media and a growing lack of trust in and influence of mainstream news outlets.\n[\n771\n]\n[\n772\n]\nTrump embraced alternative media through podcasts and online streamers such as\nJoe Rogan\n,\nAdin Ross\n,\nTheo Von\n, and the\nNelk Boys\n.\nThe New York Times\nreported that such avenues \"presented a way for Mr. Trump to sidestep more confrontational interviews with professional journalists, where he might face tough questions, fact-checks and detailed policy debates. The influencers he met with rarely challenged Mr. Trump, and often lavished him with praise.\"\n[\n773\n]\nObservers also highlighted Trump's courting of the \"\nmanosphere\n\",\n[\n774\n]\na collection of what\nThe Guardian\ndescribed as \"male\npodcasters\n, influencers and public figures\" that \"marketed themselves as\nfree-thinking\npundits who evaded the bounds of political classification\".\n[\n775\n]\nPost-election research showed that nearly 40% of young voters got their news from social media influencers, and despite claims of conservative\ncensorship\n, a majority of influencers leaned right.\n[\n776\n]\nThe New York Times\nreported that Trump's super PAC had joined a long list of presidential campaigns that made a \"technological leap or innovation\" while targeting key voters.\nThe Times\nhighlighted the use of\ntargeted advertising\nof individual undecided voters on\nstreaming video platforms\nthat allowed it to save money, while Harris largely targeted ads on streaming platforms by geography. It reported the Trump team's findings that the undecided electorate was younger, black, and Hispanic, and that such voters largely used streaming media over traditional broadcast television.\n[\n777\n]\nSee also\nPolitics portal\nUnited States portal\n2024 United States elections\n2024 United States gubernatorial elections\n2024 United States House of Representatives elections\n2024 United States Senate elections\nTimeline of the 2024 United States presidential election\nRepublican Party efforts to disrupt the 2024 United States presidential election\nNotes\n^\nJump up to:\na\nb\nThe majority of voters\nvoted early\nbefore November 5 in person or\nby mail\n,\n[\n4\n]\nwith the earliest state starting on September 11.\n[\n5\n]\n^\nJump up to:\na\nb\nCongress will officially certify the Electoral College votes on January 6, 2025.\n^\nJump up to:\na\nb\nAttributed to multiple references:\n[\n321\n]\n[\n322\n]\n[\n323\n]\n[\n324\n]\n[\n325\n]\n[\n326\n]\n[\n327\n]\n[\n328\n]\n[\n329\n]\n[\n330\n]\n^\nJump up to:\na\nb\nAttributed to multiple references:\n[\n157\n]\n[\n158\n]\n[\n161\n]\n[\n162\n]\n[\n163\n]\n[\n164\n]\n[\n165\n]\n[\n166\n]\n^\nJump up to:\na\nb\nc\nAttributed to multiple references:\n[\n265\n]\n[\n266\n]\n[\n267\n]\n[\n268\n]\n[\n269\n]\n[\n270\n]\n[\n271\n]\n[\n272\n]\n[\n273\n]\n[\n274\n]\n[\n275\n]\n[\n276\n]\n[\n277\n]\n[\n278\n]\n^\nAttributed to multiple references:\n[\n70\n]\n[\n71\n]\n[\n72\n]\n[\n73\n]\n[\n74\n]\n[\n75\n]\n^\nNew York Penal Law\ndefines\nrape\nas vaginal penetration by the penis, which Carroll stated perhaps entered only \"halfway\".\n[\n121\n]\n[\n122\n]\n[\n123\n]\n[\n124\n]\n^\nA state law passed in late January 2024 expanded the state's legal definition of rape to include nonconsensual vaginal, anal, and oral contact, effective non-retroactively beginning in September 2024.\n[\n125\n]\n^\nJump up to:\na\nb\nCalculated by taking the difference of 100% and all other candidates combined.\n^\nKennedy dropped out of the race in August 2024, although he remained on the ballot in most states.\n^\nStates rated safe by all other forecasts but\nFiveThirtyEight\nand\nThe Economist\nare omitted.

That different politicians, different parties, different policies and different rhetoric deployed in different countries have all met similar fortunes suggests that a large part of Tuesday's American result was locked in regardless of the messenger or the message.

During that period, they had gone on to win not just Clinton's Arkansas and Al Gore's Tennessee, but states such as Kentucky and Louisiana too. The story of the last three decades has been one of political success for Democrats, ... yet it is also one of narrowing political constituencies and pyrrhic victories, as the party attracted college-educated professionals at the expense of the non-college-educated majority. ...
